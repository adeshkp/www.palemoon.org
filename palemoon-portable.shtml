      <h1> Pale Moon Portable 27.2.1<br>
      </h1>
      <h3> You can now take Pale Moon anywhere with you!<br>
      </h3>
You've enjoyed Pale Moon at home, or at the office. You've wondered if
you could use it elsewhere: in a library, on a public computer, in a
cybercaf√©... You need something portable, that is as simple as plugging
in your USB stick and running your favorite browser, with all your
bookmarks and passwords at your fingertips? Then here is the answer:
Pale Moon Portable!<br>
Following the trend of other browsers, a portable installation has been
created, which, thanks to <a href="http://www.winpenpack.com/">winPenPack</a>'s
X-launcher that the portable launcher is based on, is completely
self-contained. Nothing is stored on the host computer; your bookmarks,
passwords, history, downloads, etc. stay neatly where they belong: on
your stick.<br>
      <br>
      <big class="c3"><span class="c2">Note: these portables are not
meant to have file/URL associations or integration with the desktop.
Their settings cater specifically to use on multiple hosts, run from
removable media.<br>
      <br>
      </span></big> If you require <span class="c2">desktop
integration of any kind</span> (including pinned taskbar entries,
launching a mail application from mailto: links, remembering default
download locations, etc.), it is recommended that you do <span
 class="c2">not</span> use Pale Moon Portable, but the normal desktop
version instead! <span class="c4">Pale Moon portable has been
specifically designed to take with you on removable media with high
wear and slow access, and its default settings reflect this.</span>
Using it on a stationary computer has a number of drawbacks and is not
recommended.<br>
      <h3> How do I use this? </h3>
Three simple steps:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the Pale Moon Portable file (below) </li>
        <li>Extract the contents of the file to your USB stick in a
folder of your choice:<br>
Run the .EXE file and tell it where to unpack<br>
        </li>
        <li>Run <span class="c2">palemoon-portable.exe</span> (not
palemoon.exe) in the location you unpacked to<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
That's it! Simple enough?<br>
The first time you run Pale Moon Portable, it may take a fairly long
time to load, because it creates a new personal profile on your USB
stick for you. This can take some time, also depending on the speed of
your stick - up to 30 seconds, usually. After that, it will be much
faster to start.<br>
      <br>
Of course, you don't have to use a USB stick; <span class="c2">any
writable medium would work</span>: External harddisk, a networked
drive, even an MP3 player if it allows you to access it as a drive in
Windows.<br>
Do note however that Pale Moon Portable <span class="c2">doesn't run
from read-only media</span> like CD-ROM or DVD-ROM; it needs write
access to the location it is run from.<br>
      <h2> Download links:</h2>
Pale Moon portable is available for Windows only at this time.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c5">IMPORTANT:</span> You are <span class="c2">NOT
allowed</span> to redistribute the portable if you have made <span
 class="c2">ANY changes to the archive</span>! You are ONLY allowed to
redistribute the binary package if it's completely unaltered! <span
 class="c2">For any other redistribution</span> of the binaries with
the Pale Moon name and logo, e.g. with added extensions, languages,
plugins, tools, etc., you <span class="c2">MUST get permission

      <h3><a name="Upgrade"></a> I already have an earlier version of
palemoon-portable. How do I upgrade? </h3>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Recommended
method:</span><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Download and extract the portable version of your choice to
an <span style="font-weight: bold;">empty</span> folder.</li>
        <li>Copy the "user" folder from your old installation over to
your new one.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Optionally, if you have created a user.ini file for the
portable, also copy this file to the new folder, or
duplicate any changes you have made to the old .ini file.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Test if everything is OK, and if so, delete the old
installation folder.<br>

      <span class="c2">Note on using Pale Moon's internal updater:</span>
      <span class="c10">NOT RECOMMENDED!</span> You can also use "Check
for updates" in Pale Moon Portable itself, but this will only update
the browser, not the portable shell. On occasion (infrequently) some
changes are made to the shell to provide improvements or updates. You
will not get these changes if you use the internal updater, and this
-may- cause problems or inconsistencies with documentation. Before you
ask for support for an issue, always first try to use the full portable
package if you have used the internal updater of the browser. Also, <span
 class="c11">on occasion, updates are made that are specific only to
the portable version, which will not be picked up by the internal
updater</span>.<span class="c2"></span><br>
