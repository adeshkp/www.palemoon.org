              Pale Moon Portable 26.5.0<br>
            </h1>
            <h3>
              You can now take Pale Moon anywhere with you!<br>
            </h3>You've enjoyed Pale Moon at home, or at the office. You've wondered if you could use it elsewhere: in
            a library, on a public computer, in a cybercaf√©... You need something portable, that is as simple as
            plugging in your USB stick and running your favorite browser, with all your bookmarks and passwords at your
            fingertips? Then here is the answer: Pale Moon Portable!<br>
            Following the trend of other browsers, a portable installation has been created, which, thanks to <a href="http://www.winpenpack.com/">winPenPack</a>'s X-launcher that the portable launcher is based on, is
            completely self-contained. Nothing is stored on the host computer; your bookmarks, passwords, history,
            downloads, etc. stay neatly where they belong: on your stick.<br>
            <br>
            <big class="c3"><span class="c2">Note: these portables are not meant to have file/URL associations or integration with the
            desktop. Their settings cater specifically to use on multiple hosts, run from removable media.<br>
      <br>
</span></big>
            If you require <span class="c2">desktop integration of any kind</span> (including pinned taskbar entries, launching a mail application from mailto: links,
            remembering default download locations, etc.), it is recommended that you do <span class="c2">not</span> use Pale Moon Portable, but the normal
            desktop version instead! <span class="c4">Pale Moon portable has been specifically designed to take with
            you on removable media with high wear and slow access, and its default settings reflect this.</span> Using
            it on a stationary computer has a number of drawbacks and is not recommended.<br>
            <h3>
              How do I use this?
            </h3>Three simple steps:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Download the Pale Moon Portable file (below)
              </li>
              <li>Extract the contents of the file to your USB stick in a folder of your choice:<br>
                Run the .EXE file and tell it where to unpack<br>
              </li>
              <li>Run <span class="c2">palemoon-portable.exe</span> (not palemoon.exe) in the location you unpacked
              to<br>
              </li>
            </ol>That's it! Simple enough?<br>
            The first time you run Pale Moon Portable, it may take a fairly long time to load, because it creates a new
            personal profile on your USB stick for you. This can take some time, also depending on the speed of your
            stick - up to 30 seconds, usually. After that, it will be much faster to start.<br>
            <br>
            Of course, you don't have to use a USB stick; <span class="c2">any writable medium would work</span>:
            External harddisk, a networked drive, even an MP3 player if it allows you to access it as a drive in
            Windows.<br>
            Do note however that Pale Moon Portable <span class="c2">doesn't run from read-only media</span> like
            CD-ROM or DVD-ROM; it needs write access to the location it is run from.<br>
            <h2>
              Download links:</h2>Pale Moon portable is available for Windows only at this time.<br>
      <br>
<span class="c5">IMPORTANT:</span> You are <span class="c2">NOT allowed</span> to redistribute the
            portable if you have made <span class="c2">ANY changes to the archive</span>! You are ONLY allowed to
            redistribute the binary package if it's completely unaltered! <span class="c2">For any other
            redistribution</span> of the binaries with the Pale Moon name and logo, e.g. with added extensions,
            languages, plugins, tools, etc., you <span class="c2">MUST get permission beforehand</span>. Full details

            <h3><a name="Upgrade"></a>
              I already have an earlier version of palemoon-portable. How do I upgrade?
            </h3><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Recommended method:</span><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Download and extract the portable version of your choice to an empty folder.</li>
        <li>Copy the "user" folder from your old installation over to your new one.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Optionally, if you have created a user.ini file for the
portable, also copy this file to the new folder, or
duplicate any changes you have made to the old .ini file.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Test if everything is OK, and if so, delete the old installation folder.<br>
        </li>
      </ol><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternative:</span><br>
      <br>
Since Pale Moon Portable comes in a "virgin" state, you can also simply download and overwrite an existing
            Pale Moon Portable folder with the files from a newer version. Your user profile will remain untouched as
            it doesn't exist in a freshly extracted Pale Moon Portable.<br>
<span class="c2"></span><br>
            <span class="c5">Important:</span> If you have made changes to palemoon-portable.ini yourself, you will
            have to make these changes again as the .ini file will be <span class="c2">overwritten</span>. The solution
            is to save this file as "user.ini" which will take precedence over palemoon-portable.ini if found by the
            launcher.<br>
<br>
            
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" noshade="noshade"><br>
            <span class="c2">Note on using Pale Moon's internal updater:</span> <span class="c10">NOT
            RECOMMENDED!</span> You can also use "Check for updates" in Pale Moon Portable itself, but this will only
            update the browser, not the portable shell. On occasion (infrequently) some changes are made to the shell
            to provide improvements or updates. You will not get these changes if you use the internal updater, and
            this -may- cause problems or inconsistencies with documentation. Before you ask for support for an issue,
            always first try to use the full portable package if you have used the internal updater of the browser.
            Also, <span class="c11">on occasion, updates are made that are specific only to the portable version, which
            will not be picked up by the internal updater</span>.<br>
            <br>
            <span class="c2">Optional (advanced):</span>
If you are afraid it may still overwrite something you don't want it
to, then the alternative is to download the standard Pale Moon ZIP file
(not the portable one), and replace the files and folders in the Pale
Moon folder in \bin\ with the ones from the ZIP file. You could simply
overwrite, but it is recommended that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">remove</span> the old files first before you copy the new ones. The same note here as for
            using the internal updater: you will only update the browser, and not the portable shell. <br>
