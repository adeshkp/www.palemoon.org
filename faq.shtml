              The following FAQ entries relate to general questions:
            </h2>
            <h3>
              <a name="Is_Pale_Moon_safe_to_use" id="Is_Pale_Moon_safe_to_use"></a>Is Pale Moon safe to use?
            </h3>Absolutely! Pale Moon is based on the Mozilla release source code that has a large community of
            developers and security-aware people, next to having seen over a decade of development by now. In addition,
            the Pale Moon team checks and verifies any reports of issues that might impact your safety on the web. It
            includes, among other things, protection against dangerous add-ons, automatic checking for updates of
            add-ons, password protection (master password), website-identity information in the address bar, and
            private browsing.<br>
            <br>
            Pale Moon's development includes a critical evaluation of potential security risks which are addressed in
            each new release, with on occasion a point-release for critical issues that is released as soon as possible
            after the security issue comes to light.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="#top">[^ Top ^]</a><br>
            <br>
            <h3>
              <a name="My_antivirus_software_complains" id="My_antivirus_software_complains"></a>My antivirus software
              complains that Pale Moon is a trojan, keylogger, PUP, PUA, ...
            </h3>Some Antivirus software is a little too paranoid in their scanning for potentially dangerous programs.
            It seems scanning with what is called "heuristics" is still something extremely difficult for antivirus
            suites to implement properly, and as a result, some AV scanners are rather paranoid whenever a complex
            piece of optimized software is encountered, especially if it interacts with multiple other programs and the
            Internet (like the plugin container does). <span class="c2">Pale Moon has been scanned by several leading
            and independent software distributors and found to be 100% clean and safe.</span><br>
            <br>
            If your anti-malware package keeps complaining and your system is otherwise clean, please report it to your
            security software vendor as a false positive. Reporting it to the browser author serves no purpose as it's
            the malware detector's scanning engine that needs fixing.<br>
            <br>
A critical note: the popular AVG and Norton scanners seems to be
particularly paranoid about Pale Moon and have, in numerous cases,
"fixed" what wasn't broken, i.e. deleted parts of the browser resulting
in a broken or destroyed browser. It's therefore recommended to never
let an AV suite "automatically clean" your system. There are plenty of
free-for-home-use antivirus packages available to verify the detection
and get a "second opinion" if you don't trust what you downloaded.<br>

            <h3>
              <a name="Why_do_some_add-ons_not_work" id="Why_do_some_add-ons_not_work"></a>Why do some add-ons not work
              (properly) with Pale Moon?
            </h3>Pale Moon is forked from Firefox, and there are some significant differences between the two browsers. As
            such, Pale Moon has its own (exclusive) extensions that were specifically written for it, which should
            always work. In addition, Pale Moon also allows Firefox extensions to be installed, as long as these
            extensions are compatible with version 24 of Firefox (since that is the closest matching version from an
            add-on perspective). These Firefox extensions are not guaranteed to work, but in most cases can be made
            compatible with a few small alterations. This incompatibility can be caused by several different things,
            the most important:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Difference in user interface or back-end code: Pale Moon is different from Firefox "under the hood"
              as well as in what is visible. Firefox extensions that use specific part of the user interface or
              back-end code that aredifferent will have compatibility issues.
              </li>
              <li>Difference in GUID (unique identifier): Firefox and Pale Moon use a different unique identifier. This
              identifier is used to cater extensions or parts thereof (like overlays) to specific "target
              applications". If Pale Moon's GUID isn't included in such extensions, it will likely be missing user
              interface elements. You will have to contact the extension developer and ask for pale Moon's GUID to be
              added in the proper places to make it compatible.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Naming: some add-ons or external programs expect the program to be called "firefox.exe" - a simple
              problem with a simple solution for the add-on programmers to implement.
              </li>
              <li>Use of components not present in Pale Moon: If an add-on tries to use components that are
              specifically excluded from Pale Moon (like accessibility features, ActiveX, parental controls) it will
              fail.</li>
        <li>The extension was never written for our extension API level (e.g. Australis-only extensions).<br>
        </li>

            </ul>That being said, most add-ons do function without a hitch. Even so, you are encouraged to check the <a href="https://addons.palemoon.org/">Pale Moon add-ons site</a> for Pale Moon specific add-ons or alternatives to what you are using if you suspect there may be a compatibility issue.<br>

              preloader?
            </h3>Pale Moon does not come with a preloader, or "quick start" tool that loads components of the browser
            in memory and keeps them resident there. As it is, startup times of Pale Moon are generally sufficiently
            low not to need something like that. External preloaders may not work with Pale Moon for the same reason
            some add-ons may not work.<br>

            <br>
            Note: If you are one of the people using a ZIP packed version, it is recommended you remove the old browser
            installation first, and not unpack a new version on top of an old one, because the program structure and
            included files may have changed across versions.<br>

            <h3>
              <a name="What_are_the_differences_with_Firefox" id="What_are_the_differences_with_Firefox"></a>What are
              the differences with Firefox?
            </h3>Firefox
and Pale Moon have similar roots in the Mozilla Community code, and
Pale Moon has been originally based on Firefox code, but as a product,
Pale Moon has diverted significantly from its sibling, and has its own
code, development path and future, independent of what the Mozilla
Corporation does with Firefox.<br>
      <br>
Firefox is created with one-size-fits-all in mind; Pale Moon is created with
efficiency and user choice in mind. <span class="c3">These two approaches are mutually exclusive</span>, and result in
            some functions being present/absent in one browser but not the other, as well as different system
            requirements for either browser. Pale Moon also has a different set of goals as to what should be included
            in the browser and intended audience.<br>
            <br>
            Pale Moon has a number of differences in the user interface and feature set to provide an as intuitive,
            predictable, logical and usable user interface as possible for the best user experience. Additional and
            removed features are, of course, specific to Pale Moon, meaning you may find some different way of working
            Pale Moon than what you are used to from other browsers, and some features or options not found in other
            browsers at all.<br><br>
            Note that Pale Moon will <span class="c4">never</span> adopt the Australis (Firefox 29 and later)
            interface and aims to remain a fully XUL-driven browser with full user interface customizability.<br>
      <br>
Also please note that Pale Moon has not run rampant with its releases
and even though there is a big gap in version number between the two,
you should never assume Pale Moon is somehow an "outdated Firefox".
Pale Moon is a completely separate product with its own roadmap,
direction, versioning and release schedule, unlike all other
"Firefox-based" browsers out there.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="#top">[^ Top ^]</a><br>

            <h3>
              <a name="How_does_it_compare_to_other_browsers" id="How_does_it_compare_to_other_browsers"></a>How does
              it compare to other browsers?
            </h3>This is very much a subjective question, and there is no single answer to it. Short answer: YMMV (Your
            Mileage May Vary) -- it all depends on what you are looking for in a browser to choose which one would work
            best for you. In general, Pale Moon aims to be full-featured, but without compromise to efficient
            resource/hardware use. <span class="c5">It doesn't necessarily aim to be a lightweight browser</span>,
but seems to achieve that goal in some circumstances as a side effect.
Overall, comparison between browsers would put Pale Moon in a similar
position to Firefox since it it has its roots in the same rendering and scripting
engines. Goanna is a fork of Gecko, and they both use *Monkey-based JavaScript engines.<br>
Synthetic benchmarks aren't the end-all of things, so
it's difficult to obtain unbiased comparisons between different
browsers through them, and a higher benchmark score doesn't necessarily
mean that a browser would perform better in a real-world browsing
situation. Quite the opposite is the case in some situations.<br>

            </h3>Yes, you will be able to start Firefox and Pale Moon at the same time since they are completely
            different products that only share a common ancestor.<br>

            </h3>To migrate a Firefox profile (bookmarks, history, add-ons, etc.) to Pale Moon, you can <a href="migrationtool.shtml">USE THIS TOOL</a>.
This tool will copy the profile(s) from Firefox to Pale Moon. Please
note that this tool is limited because of the increasing differences
between Firefox and Pale Moon.<br>
            If, for whatever reason, the tool doesn't work, you will have to copy things manually.<br>

              Firefox and Pale Moon work together in the future?
            </h3>Since
the Mozilla Corporation has obviously chosen to follow a different path
at the management level and has set different goals for its browser, it
doesn't seem likely that Pale Moon and Firefox will ever see a
unification or joining of forces. Quite the opposite, in fact. Of
course, that doesn't mean there is no communication or that there is a
"browser war" going on between the two - in fact, there is regular
communication about security updates, for example, and one could say
that the diversity seen here offers different users a closer match to
what they need.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="mailto:beltzner%5Bat%5Dmozilla.com" rel="contact colleague"></a> There have been and are growing
            conflicts of interests between Pale Moon and Firefox as far as the so-called UX (User eXperience)
            developments are concerned. This results in a different user interface approach in Pale Moon. For example,
            less stress is put on minimizing the size of UI elements or saving every pixel possible to benefit the
            content area - in this day and age of full HD monitors and laptops that seems to be very counter-intuitive.
            <span class="c5">Australis is considered unacceptable</span>, and will not be used.<br>
            <br>
On the flipside, some developers seem to complain that Pale Moon "is no
different than other optimized (re)builds out there", meaning other
people who have built Firefox from source with minimal tweaks or
changes. Following the step-by-step
instructions in the Mozilla Developer Center, and probably with some
trial and error, anyone with a decent level of computer knowledge <span class="c3">could</span>
build Firefox (if you have the right hardware and software),
but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be stable or efficient,
or that the result would be more than just a differently configured
rebuild of Firefox. <br>
      <br>
Pale Moon is most certainly not "just a rebuild" of
existing Firefox code, unlike other "alternative" Firefox browsers out
there. As Pale Moon has developed, so has the amount of individual code
for the browser, steadily diverging Pale Moon from its sibling in the
direction aimed for in this browser - having transformed it from an
optimized build (which it was when it first started out in 2009) into a
true "fork" of Mozilla code and being completely independent now.<br>
            <br>
            Some have even claimed that the Pale Moon project as such was given shape to gain fame -- they should
            consider that the popularity was unexpected. <span class="c4">Pale Moon is, and has always been, released
            in the hope that it might be useful to its users</span>, nothing more. It is a full-time commitment of our
            small but dedicated team of developers, and I'm happy to see it finding good use among its growing number of users.<br>

              bundle the extension/add-on {xxxx}?
            </h3>Pale Moon releases come without any pre-defined and pre-installed add-ons/extensions.<br>
            There are a number of "custom" browsers out that are basically a stock Firefox with simply added a number
            of add-ons and released as a package - this is fine if you are looking for a browser that comes
            pre-installed with extensions for a specific purpose and you don't want to install them yourself, but this
            is not part of Pale Moon's goals.<br>
            <br>
            Pale Moon will be released as a browser without any extensions, since users of Pale Moon should have
            <span class="c5">freedom of choice</span> to install or not install any extensions/add-ons that are
            available for it. I would of course strongly recommend to look through the add-ons site for Pale Moon and
            Firefox and pick some that you think work well for you, or use the add-ons window in the browser to search
            for extensions on specific keywords, as there are some real gems out there, but by policy, <span class="c5">Pale Moon will not bundle any add-ons with the browser</span>.<br>
            <br>
            If you see Pale Moon offered bundled with extensions or "extra functionality" or whatever people would like
            to call it, it will be an unofficial download and is not recommended (and potentially dangerous or unstable
            - you don't know what all has been added to or changed in the browser). <span class="c5">Don't rely on
            unofficial downloads or releases offered with add-ons/extensions already in it.</span> Go the official
            route if you need extra functionality and install Pale Moon, then add your extensions to it.<br>
            <br>
            <span class="c6">Historical note: The</span> <span class="c7">one</span><span class="c6">
notable exception was the Pale Moon status bar add-on that came with
versions 4 to 9; this was chosen as a solution over editing the core
layout of the browser to prevent incompatibilities and unnecessary
bugs, as well as being a result of getting direct feedback from Pale
Moon users. It was therefore considered a "core functionality add-on"
that forms an essential part of the browser itself. In later versions,
this add-on is no longer included as an add-on, since the functionality
has been re-integrated into the browser.</span><br>
