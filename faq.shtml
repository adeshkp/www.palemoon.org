      <h2 class="faq">The following FAQ entries relate to general questions:</h2>
      <h3><a name="Is_Pale_Moon_safe_to_use"></a>Is Pale Moon safe to
use?</h3>
Absolutely!
Pale Moon is based on the Mozilla release source code that has a
large community of developers and security-aware people, next to having
seen over a decade of development by now. In addition, the Pale Moon
team checks and verifies any reports of issues that might impact your
safety on the web. It includes, among other
things, protection against dangerous add-ons, automatic
checking for updates of add-ons, password
protection (master password), website-identity information in the
address bar, and private browsing.<br>
      <br>
Pale Moon's development includes a critical evaluation of potential
security risks which are addressed in each new release, with on
occasion a point-release for critical issues that is released as soon
as possible after the security issue comes to light.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="#top">[^ Top ^]</a><br>
      <br>
      <h3><a name="My_antivirus_software_complains"></a>My antivirus
software complains that Pale Moon is a trojan, keylogger, PUP, PUA, ...</h3>
Some Antivirus software is a little too paranoid in their scanning for
potentially dangerous programs. It seems scanning with what is called
"heuristics" is still something extremely difficult for antivirus suites to
implement properly, and as a result, some AV scanners are rather
paranoid whenever a complex piece of optimized software is encountered,
especially if it interacts with multiple other programs and the Internet (like the
plugin container does).
      <span style="color: red;">Pale Moon has been scanned by several leading and independent software
distributors and
found to be 100% clean and safe.</span><br>
      <br>If
your anti-malware package keeps complaining and your system is
otherwise clean, please report it to your security software vendor as a
false positive. Reporting it to the browser author serves no purpose as
it's the malware detector's scanning engine that needs fixing.<br>
      <br>
A critical note: the popular AVG and Norton scanners seems to be particularly
paranoid about Pale Moon and have, in numerous cases, "fixed" what
wasn't broken, i.e. deleted parts of the browser resulting in a broken
or destroyed browser. This has been reported <span style="font-style: italic;">many</span>
times to the AV developers but has not been addressed, and the
official recommendation is therefore: find yourself a different
antivirus package. There are plenty of free-for-home-use antivirus
packages available.<br>

      <h3><a name="Why_do_some_add-ons_not_work"></a>Why do some
add-ons not work (properly) with Pale Moon?</h3>
Pale Moon is based on Firefox, but there are some significant
differences between the two browsers. As such, Pale Moon has its own
(exclusive) extensions that were specifically written for it, which
should always work. In addition, pale Moon also allows Firefox
extensions to be installed, as long as these extensions are compatible
with version 24 of Firefox (since that is the closest matching version
from an add-on perspective). These Firefox extensions are not
guaranteed to work, but in most cases can be made compatible with a few
small alterations. This incompatibility can be caused by several
different things, the most important:<br>
      <ul><li>Difference
in user interface or back-end code: Pale Moon is different from Firefox
"under the hood" as well as in what is visible. Firefox extensions that
use specific part of the user interface or back-end code that
aredifferent will have compatibility issues.</li>
        <li>Difference in GUID (unique identifier): Firefox and Pale
Moon use a different unique identifier. This identifier is used to
cater extensions or parts thereof (like overlays) to specific "target
applications". If Pale Moon's GUID isn't included in such extensions,
it will likely be missing user interface elements. You will have to
contact the extension developer and ask for pale Moon's GUID to be
added in the proper places to make it compatible.<br>
        </li>
<li>Naming: some add-ons or external programs expect the
program to be called "firefox.exe" - a simple problem with a simple
solution for the add-on programmers to implement.</li><li>Use of components not present in Pale Moon: If an add-on
tries to use components that are specifically excluded from Pale Moon
(like accessibility features, ActiveX, parental controls) it will fail.</li></ul>
That being said, most add-ons function without a hitch.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="faq.shtml#top">[^ Top ^]</a><br>
      <br>
      <h3><a name="Does_it_come_with_a_preloader"></a>Does it come with
a preloader?</h3>
Pale Moon does not come with a preloader, or "quick start" tool that
loads components of the browser in memory and keeps them resident
there. As it is, startup times of Pale Moon are generally sufficiently low not to
need something like that. External preloaders may not work with Pale
Moon for the same reason some add-ons may not work.<br>
That being said, someone is working on creating a preloader application
for Pale Moon (adapting a Firefox preloader to work with Pale Moon).

      <br><h3>Will there be a version in my (<a name="non-English"></a>non-English) language?</h3>
Pale Moon is released as a US-English browser. If you prefer a
different language for the User Interface, you can install a Pale Moon
language pack and set your browser to use it.<br>

      <h3><a name="How_do_I_update_Pale_Moon"></a>How do I update Pale
Moon?</h3>
Pale Moon has a built-in update checker, which is enabled by default
since 3.6.13. If you let Pale Moon automatically check for updates
(which occurs once a week by default), you will be notified and given
the option to download and install the later version from within the
browser. You can also manually check and start the update from Pale Moon's Help -&gt; About dialog box.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;"></span>To be informed more quickly of
new releases, and stay updated with some other miscellaneous news
related to Pale Moon and the Pale Moon web site, you have a few options:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>You can <a href="http://forum.palemoon.org/ucp.php?mode=register">register on the Pale Moon forum</a>,
and subscribe to the Announcements board, which will send you an e-mail
when a new announcement is posted to it. Your e-mail is safe, it will
never
be disclosed to anyone for any reason.</li>
        <li>You can use the RSS/Atom feed of the forum's Announcements board,
either by using a separate RSS reader or simply by going to the
following URL and making it a Live Bookmark (built-in functionality of
Pale Moon): <a href="http://forum.palemoon.org/feed.php?f=1">http://forum.palemoon.org/feed.php?f=1</a></li>

        </li>
      </ol>

      <a href="https://twitter.com/palemoonbrowser"></a>To update Pale Moon manually, simply download the installer of the new version
and run it. No need to uninstall first! You can install the new version
in the same location as the old one, and it will perform an upgrade.<br>
      <br>
Note: If you are one of the people using a ZIP packed version, it is
recommended you remove the old browser installation first, and not
unpack a new version on top of an old one, because the program structure and included files may have changed across versions.<br>

      <br><h3><a name="What_are_the_differences_with_Firefox"></a>What are
the differences with Firefox?</h3>
Firefox and Pale Moon have similar roots in the Mozilla Community code,
and Pale Moon has been based on Firefox code, but as a product, Pale
Moon has diverted significantly from its sibling. Firefox is created
with maximum compatibility and one-size-fits-all in mind, Pale Moon is
created with efficiency and user choice in mind. <span style="font-style: italic;">These two approaches are mutually exclusive</span>,
and result in some functions being
enabled/disabled in one browser but not the other, as well as different
system requirements for either browser. Pale Moon also has a
different set of goals as to what should be included in the browser and
intended audience. For extensive detail
on the actual differences under the hood, please check the <a href="technical.shtml#Firefox_Differences">technical details</a> page.<br>
      <br>Pale
Moon has a number of changes to the user
interface and feature set, to
provide an as intuitive, predictable, logical and usable user interface
as possible for the best user experience. Additional and removed
features are, of course, specific to Pale Moon, meaning you may find
some different way of working Pale Moon
than what you are used to from other browsers, and some features or
options not found in other browsers at all.<br>
You may be interested in the overview table of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CT9YLUjMyb5Xf8HHcQ66lVh-SALb7cWTmUKgeJOvk00/pubhtml">features compared to several versions of Firefox</a> for a quick overview of the most important differences.<br>
      <br>
Note that Pale Moon will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> adopt the Australis (Firefox 29 and later) interface. <br>

      <h3><a name="How_does_it_compare_to_other_browsers"></a>How does
it compare to other browsers?</h3>
This is very much a subjective question, and there is no single answer
to it. Short answer: YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary) -- it all depends on
what you are looking for in a browser to choose which one would work
best for you. In general, Pale Moon aims to be full-featured, but
without compromise to efficient resource/hardware use. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It doesn't
necessarily aim to be a lightweight browser</span>,
but seems to achieve that
goal in some circumstances as a side effect. Overall, comparison
between browsers would put Pale Moon in a similar position to its
sibling Firefox since it is based on the same rendering engine (Gecko). Synthetic
benchmarks aren't the end-all of things, so it's difficult to
obtain unbiased comparisons between different browsers through them, and a higher
benchmark score doesn't necessarily mean that a browser would perform
better in a real-world browsing situation.<br>

<br>
      
      <h3><a name="Will_Firefox_and_Pale_Moon_work_together"></a>Will Firefox and Pale Moon work together in the future?</h3>Since
the Mozilla Corporation has obviously chosen to follow a different path
at the management level and has set different goals for its browser, it
doesn't seem likely that Pale Moon and
Firefox will ever see a unification or joining of forces. Quite the
opposite, in fact. Of course, that doesn't mean there is no
communication or that there is a "browser war" going on between the two
- in fact, there is regular communication about security updates, for
example. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="mailto:beltzner%5Bat%5Dmozilla.com" rel="contact colleague"></a> There have been and are growing conflicts of interests between Pale Moon
and Firefox as far as the so-called UX (User eXperience) developments
are concerned. This results in a different user interface approach in
Pale Moon. For example, less stress is put on minimizing the size of UI
elements or saving every pixel possible to benefit the content area -
in this day and age of full HD monitors and laptops that seems to be
very counter-intuitive. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Australis is considered unacceptable</span>, and will not be used.<br>

      <br>
On the flipside, some developers seem to complain that Pale Moon "is no
different than other optimized builds out there", meaning other people
who have built Firefox from source on Windows machines, which might be
true to some very limited extent (since they are both Gecko-based browsers). Following the
step-by-step instructions in the Mozilla Developer Center, and probably
with some trial and error, anyone with a decent level of computer
knowledge <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span>
build Firefox on Windows (if you have the right
hardware and software), but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to
be stable or
efficient, or that the result would be more than just a differently
configured rebuild of Firefox. Pale Moon is most certainly not "just a
rebuild" of existing Firefox code, unlike other "alternative" Firefox
browsers out there. As Pale Moon has developed, so has the amount of
individual
code for the browser, steadily diverging Pale Moon from its sibling in
the direction aimed for in this browser - having transformed it from an
optimized build into a true "fork" of Firefox.<br>
      <br>
Some have even claimed that the Pale Moon project as such
was given shape to gain fame -- they should consider that the
popularity was unexpected. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pale Moon is, and has always been, released
in the hope that it might be useful to its users</span>,
nothing more. It is a full-time commitment (between
developing/building several different versions, releasing them,
performing website maintenance, and running the forum), and I'm happy
to see it finding
good use among
its users.<br>

      <h3><a name="Will_Pale_Moon_bundle_the_extension"></a>Will Pale Moon bundle the extension/add-on {xxxx}?</h3>
Pale Moon releases come without any pre-defined and pre-installed add-ons/extensions.<br>
There are a number of "custom" browsers out that are basically a stock Firefox
with simply added a number of add-ons and released as a package - this
is fine if you are looking for a browser that comes pre-installed with
extensions for a specific purpose and you don't want to install them
yourself, but this is not part of Pale Moon's goals.<br>
      <br>
Pale Moon will be released as a browser without any extensions, since users of Pale Moon should have <span style="font-weight: bold;">freedom of choice</span>
to install or not install any extensions/add-ons that are available for
it. I would of course strongly recommend to look through the add-ons
site for Pale Moon and Firefox and pick some that you think work well for you, or use
the add-ons window in the browser to search for extensions on specific
keywords, as there are some real gems out there, but by policy, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pale Moon will not bundle any add-ons with the browser</span>.<br>
      <br>If you see Pale Moon offered bundled with extensions or "extra
functionality" or whatever people would like to call it, it will be an
unofficial download and is not recommended (and potentially dangerous
or unstable - you don't know what all has been added to or changed in
the browser). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't rely on unofficial downloads or releases offered
with add-ons/extensions already in it.</span> Go the official route if you
need extra functionality and install Pale Moon, then add your
extensions to it.<br>

notable exception was the Pale Moon status bar add-on that came
with versions 4 to 9; this was chosen as a solution over editing the
core
layout of the browser to prevent incompatibilities and unnecessary
bugs, as well as being a result of getting direct feedback from Pale
Moon users. It was therefore considered a "core functionality add-on"
that forms an essential part of the browser itself. In later versions,
this add-on is no longer bundled as the functionality has been
re-integrated into the browser.</span><br>
