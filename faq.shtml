      <h2 class="faq"> The following FAQ entries relate to general
questions: </h2>
      <h3> <a name="Is_Pale_Moon_safe_to_use"
 id="Is_Pale_Moon_safe_to_use"></a>Is Pale Moon safe to use? </h3>
Absolutely! Pale Moon is based on the Mozilla release source code that
has a large community of developers and security-aware people, next to
having seen over a decade of development by now. In addition, the Pale
Moon team checks and verifies any reports of issues that might impact
your safety on the web. It includes, among other things, protection
against dangerous add-ons, automatic checking for updates of add-ons,
password protection (master password), website-identity information in
the address bar, and private browsing.<br>
      <br>
Pale Moon's development includes a critical evaluation of potential
security risks which are addressed in each new release, with on
occasion a point-release for critical issues that is released as soon
as possible after the security issue comes to light.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="#top">[^ Top ^]</a><br>
      <br>
      <h3> <a name="My_antivirus_software_complains"
 id="My_antivirus_software_complains"></a>My antivirus software
complains that Pale Moon is a trojan, keylogger, PUP, PUA, ... </h3>
Some Antivirus software is a little too paranoid in their scanning for
potentially dangerous programs. It seems scanning with what is called
"heuristics" is still something extremely difficult for antivirus
suites to implement properly, and as a result, some AV scanners are
rather paranoid whenever a complex piece of optimized software is
encountered, especially if it interacts with multiple other programs
and the Internet (like the plugin container does). <span class="c2">Pale
Moon has been scanned by several leading and independent software
distributors and found to be 100% clean and safe.</span><br>
      <br>
If your anti-malware package keeps complaining and your system is
otherwise clean, please report it to your security software vendor as a
false positive. Reporting it to the browser author serves no purpose as
it's the malware detector's scanning engine that needs fixing.<br>
      <br>
A critical note: the popular AVG and Norton scanners seems to be
particularly paranoid about Pale Moon and have, in numerous cases,
"fixed" what wasn't broken, i.e. deleted parts of the browser resulting
in a broken or destroyed browser. It's therefore recommended to never
let an AV suite "automatically clean" your system. There are plenty of
free-for-home-use antivirus packages available to verify the detection
and get a "second opinion" if you don't trust what you downloaded.<br>

      <h3> <a name="Why_do_some_add-ons_not_work"
 id="Why_do_some_add-ons_not_work"></a>Why do some add-ons not work
(properly) with Pale Moon? </h3>
Pale Moon is forked from Firefox, and there are some significant
differences between the two browsers. As such, Pale Moon has its own
(exclusive) extensions that were specifically written for it, which
should always work. In addition, Pale Moon also allows Firefox
extensions to be installed, as long as these extensions are compatible
with version 24 of Firefox (since that is the closest matching version
from an add-on perspective). These Firefox extensions are not
guaranteed to work, but in most cases can be made compatible with a few
small alterations. This incompatibility can be caused by several
different things, the most important:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Difference in user interface or back-end code: Pale Moon is
different from Firefox "under the hood" as well as in what is visible.
Firefox extensions that use specific part of the user interface or
back-end code that aredifferent will have compatibility issues. </li>
        <li>Difference in GUID (unique identifier): Firefox and Pale
Moon use a different unique identifier. This identifier is used to
cater extensions or parts thereof (like overlays) to specific "target
applications". If Pale Moon's GUID isn't included in such extensions,
it will likely be missing user interface elements. You will have to
contact the extension developer and ask for pale Moon's GUID to be
added in the proper places to make it compatible.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Naming: some add-ons or external programs expect the
program to be called "firefox.exe" - a simple problem with a simple
solution for the add-on programmers to implement. </li>
        <li>Use of components not present in Pale Moon: If an add-on
tries to use components that are specifically excluded from Pale Moon
(like accessibility features, ActiveX, parental controls) it will fail.</li>
        <li>The extension was never written for our extension API level
(e.g. Australis-only extensions).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
That being said, most add-ons do function without a hitch. Even so, you
are encouraged to check the <a href="https://addons.palemoon.org/">Pale
Moon add-ons site</a> for Pale Moon specific add-ons or alternatives to
what you are using if you suspect there may be a compatibility issue.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h3> <a name="Does_it_come_with_a_preloader"
 id="Does_it_come_with_a_preloader"></a>Does it come with a preloader? </h3>
Pale Moon does not come with a preloader, or "quick start" tool that
loads components of the browser in memory and keeps them resident
there. As it is, startup times of Pale Moon are generally sufficiently
low not to need something like that. External preloaders may not work
with Pale Moon for the same reason some add-ons may not work.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="#top">[^ Top ^]</a><br>
      <br>
      <h3> Will there be a version in my (<a name="non-English"
 id="non-English"></a>non-English) language? </h3>
Pale Moon is released as a US-English browser. If you prefer a
different language for the User Interface, you can install a Pale Moon
language pack and set your browser to use it.<br>

      <h3> <a name="How_do_I_update_Pale_Moon"
 id="How_do_I_update_Pale_Moon"></a>How do I update Pale Moon? </h3>
Pale Moon has a built-in update checker. If you let Pale Moon
automatically check for updates (which occurs every other day by
default), you will be notified and given the option to download and
install the later version from within the browser. You can also
manually check and start the update from Pale Moon's Help -&gt; About
dialog box.<br>
      <br>
To be informed more quickly of new releases, and stay updated with some
other miscellaneous news related to Pale Moon and the Pale Moon web
site, you have a few options:<br>

Pale Moon forum</a>, and subscribe to the Announcements board, which
will send you an e-mail when a new announcement is posted to it. Your
e-mail is safe, it will never be disclosed to anyone for any reason. </li>
        <li>You can use the RSS/Atom feed of the forum's Announcements
board, either by using a separate RSS reader or simply by going to the
following URL and making it a Live Bookmark (built-in functionality of
Pale Moon): <a href="http://forum.palemoon.org/feed.php?f=1">http://forum.palemoon.org/feed.php?f=1</a>

      </ol>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/palemoonbrowser"></a>To update Pale
Moon manually, simply download the installer of the new version and run
it. No need to uninstall first! You can install the new version in the
same location as the old one, and it will perform an upgrade.<br>
      <br>
Note: If you are one of the people using a ZIP packed version, it is
recommended you remove the old browser installation first, and not
unpack a new version on top of an old one, because the program
structure and included files may have changed across versions.<br>

      <h3> <a name="What_are_the_differences_with_Firefox"
 id="What_are_the_differences_with_Firefox"></a>What are the
differences with Firefox? </h3>
Firefox
and Pale Moon have similar roots in the Mozilla Community code, and
Pale Moon has been originally based on Firefox code, but as a product,
Pale Moon has diverted significantly from its sibling, and has its own
code, development path and future, independent of what the Mozilla
Corporation does with Firefox.<br>
      <br>
Firefox is created with one-size-fits-all in mind; Pale Moon is created
with
efficiency and user choice in mind. <span class="c3">These two
approaches are mutually exclusive</span>, and result in some functions
being present/absent in one browser but not the other, as well as
different system requirements for either browser. Pale Moon also has a
different set of goals as to what should be included in the browser and
intended audience.<br>
      <br>
Pale Moon has a number of differences in the user interface and feature
set to provide an as intuitive, predictable, logical and usable user
interface as possible for the best user experience. Additional and
removed features are, of course, specific to Pale Moon, meaning you may
find some different way of working Pale Moon than what you are used to
from other browsers, and some features or options not found in other
browsers at all.<br>
      <br>
Note that Pale Moon will <span class="c4">never</span> adopt the
Australis (Firefox 29 and later) interface and aims to remain a fully
XUL-driven browser with full user interface customizability.<br>
      <br>
Also please note that Pale Moon has not run rampant with its releases
and even though there is a big gap in version number between the two,
you should never assume Pale Moon is somehow an "outdated Firefox".
Pale Moon is a completely separate product with its own roadmap,
direction, versioning and release schedule, unlike all other
"Firefox-based" browsers out there.<br>
      <br>

      <h3> <a name="How_does_it_compare_to_other_browsers"
 id="How_does_it_compare_to_other_browsers"></a>How does it compare to
other browsers? </h3>
This is very much a subjective question, and there is no single answer
to it. Short answer: YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary) -- it all depends on
what you are looking for in a browser to choose which one would work
best for you. In general, Pale Moon aims to be full-featured, but
without compromise to efficient resource/hardware use. <span class="c5">It
doesn't necessarily aim to be a lightweight browser</span>,
but seems to achieve that goal in some circumstances as a side effect.
Overall, comparison between browsers would put Pale Moon in a similar
position to Firefox since it it has its roots in the same rendering and
scripting
engines. Goanna is a fork of Gecko, and they both use *Monkey-based
JavaScript engines.<br>
Synthetic benchmarks aren't the end-all of things, so
it's difficult to obtain unbiased comparisons between different
browsers through them, and a higher benchmark score doesn't necessarily
mean that a browser would perform better in a real-world browsing
situation. Quite the opposite is the case in some situations.<br>

Yes, you will be able to start Firefox and Pale Moon at the same time
since they are completely different products that only share a common
ancestor.<br>

 id="How_do_I_copy_my_existing_Firefox"></a>How do I copy my existing
Firefox profile to Pale Moon?<br>
      </h3>
Unfortunately, due to Mozilla's incessant changes to the different
storage formats of data in the profile, that are not directly
compatible with Pale Moon and regularly cause issues, we currently do
not have an easy way to import existing Firefox profiles as a whole.<br>
You can, however, import your bookmarks by first exporting them from
Firefox (Bookmarks -&gt; Show all Bookmarks -&gt; Import and backup
-&gt; Export bookmarks to HTML), then importing them in Pale Moon (in
the same location, but then choose "Import bookmarks from HTML").<br>
Other data like stored passwords can possibly be exported/imported
using extensions. For more assistance, please ask for help on the forum.<br>

      <h3> <a name="Will_Firefox_and_Pale_Moon_work_together"
 id="Will_Firefox_and_Pale_Moon_work_together"></a>Will Firefox and
Pale Moon work together in the future? </h3>
Since
the Mozilla Corporation has obviously chosen to follow a different path
at the management level and has set different goals for its browser, it
doesn't seem likely that Pale Moon and Firefox will ever see a
unification or joining of forces. Quite the opposite, in fact. Of
course, that doesn't mean there is no communication or that there is a
"browser war" going on between the two - in fact, there is regular
communication about security updates, for example, and one could say
that the diversity seen here offers different users a closer match to
what they need.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="mailto:beltzner%5Bat%5Dmozilla.com"
 rel="contact colleague"></a> There have been and are growing conflicts
of interests between Pale Moon and Firefox as far as the so-called UX
(User eXperience) developments are concerned. This results in a
different user interface approach in Pale Moon. For example, less
stress is put on minimizing the size of UI elements or saving every
pixel possible to benefit the content area - in this day and age of
full HD monitors and laptops that seems to be very counter-intuitive. <span
 class="c5">Australis is considered unacceptable</span>, and will not
be used.<br>
      <br>
On the flipside, some developers seem to complain that Pale Moon "is no
different than other optimized (re)builds out there", meaning other
people who have built Firefox from source with minimal tweaks or
changes. Following the step-by-step
instructions in the Mozilla Developer Center, and probably with some
trial and error, anyone with a decent level of computer knowledge <span
 class="c3">could</span>
build Firefox (if you have the right hardware and software),
but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be stable or efficient,
or that the result would be more than just a differently configured
rebuild of Firefox. <br>
      <br>
Pale Moon is most certainly not "just a rebuild" of
existing Firefox code, unlike other "alternative" Firefox browsers out
there. As Pale Moon has developed, so has the amount of individual code
for the browser, steadily diverging Pale Moon from its sibling in the
direction aimed for in this browser - having transformed it from an
optimized build (which it was when it first started out in 2009) into a
true "fork" of Mozilla code and being completely independent now.<br>
      <br>
Some have even claimed that the Pale Moon project as such was given
shape to gain fame -- they should consider that the popularity was
unexpected. <span class="c4">Pale Moon is, and has always been,
released in the hope that it might be useful to its users</span>,
nothing more. It is a full-time commitment of our small but dedicated
team of developers, and I'm happy to see it finding good use among its
growing number of users.<br>

      <h3> <a name="Will_Pale_Moon_bundle_the_extension"
 id="Will_Pale_Moon_bundle_the_extension"></a>Will Pale Moon bundle the
extension/add-on {xxxx}? </h3>
Pale Moon releases come without any pre-defined and pre-installed
add-ons/extensions.<br>
There are a number of "custom" browsers out that are basically a stock
Firefox with simply added a number of add-ons and released as a package
- this is fine if you are looking for a browser that comes
pre-installed with extensions for a specific purpose and you don't want
to install them yourself, but this is not part of Pale Moon's goals.<br>
      <br>
Pale Moon will be released as a browser without any extensions, since
users of Pale Moon should have <span class="c5">freedom of choice</span>
to install or not install any extensions/add-ons that are available for
it. I would of course strongly recommend to look through the add-ons
site for Pale Moon and Firefox and pick some that you think work well
for you, or use the add-ons window in the browser to search for
extensions on specific keywords, as there are some real gems out there,
but by policy, <span class="c5">Pale Moon will not bundle any add-ons
with the browser</span>.<br>
      <br>
If you see Pale Moon offered bundled with extensions or "extra
functionality" or whatever people would like to call it, it will be an
unofficial download and is not recommended (and potentially dangerous
or unstable - you don't know what all has been added to or changed in
the browser). <span class="c5">Don't rely on unofficial downloads or
releases offered with add-ons/extensions already in it.</span> Go the
official route if you need extra functionality and install Pale Moon,
then add your extensions to it.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c6">Historical note: The</span> <span class="c7">one</span><span
 class="c6">
notable exception was the Pale Moon status bar add-on that came with
versions 4 to 9; this was chosen as a solution over editing the core
layout of the browser to prevent incompatibilities and unnecessary
bugs, as well as being a result of getting direct feedback from Pale
Moon users. It was therefore considered a "core functionality add-on"
that forms an essential part of the browser itself. In later versions,
this add-on is no longer included as an add-on, since the functionality
has been re-integrated into the browser.</span><br>
