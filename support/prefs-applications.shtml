      <h1>Applications</h1>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="menu">Applications</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> category allows you to choose how Pale Moon handles different types of files.</span><br>
      <br>
For each content type Pale Moon recognizes, you can select an action
that will be used to handle that type of content. You can view the file
content in the browser window with formats that are natively supported
by Pale Moon (e.g. Podcasts or Web Feeds) or handled by a plugin (e.g.
PDF), open the file with an application installed on your computer (or
in some cases, with a web application), or you can save the file to
disk.<br>
      <br>
      <p>To change how Pale Moon handles a listed file type, click on its 
name to select it. Then, open the drop-down menu to select the action
 you want Pale Moon to use:
      </p>

      <ul>
<li> <strong>Preview in Pale Moon</strong>: Select this if you want 
Pale Moon to display the content in its browser window.  This is only applicable to a limited 
number of file types, namely only those that Pale Moon is able to decode directly such as Podcasts or Web Feeds.<strong><br>
Note:</strong> A particular configuration of the server hosting
a supported document could force the download of the file (disabling
the preview).</li>
        <li> <strong>Choose a feature or plugin</strong>: If you want a feature
or a plugin in Pale Moon to handle the type, and one is available,
select it from the drop-down menu. This will be indicated with "Use
[name of feature] (in Pale Moon)"<br>

        </li>
        <li> <strong>Choose an application</strong>: To choose a local or 
web application to handle a type, select the application from the 
drop-down menu. If you want a local application that is not in the menu 
to handle the type, select <strong>Use otherâ€¦</strong> from the drop-down menu and point Pale Moon to its location.
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Save file</strong>: Some file types can be saved to your computer. Select <strong>Save File</strong>
from the menu for one of these file types to have Pale Moon save that
type of file to the location specified in the Downloads settings.
</li>
      </ul>


      <strong></strong> 

      <p>Some file formats may have multiple content types, also called Internet media types, <span class="for" data-for="win">(for instance, audio/wav and audio/x-wav for Wave Sound) </span>that
 you will need to change. Also, when a plugin is available to handle a 
content type and you choose a different action for that type, Pale Moon 
will only take your chosen action when you access the type directly (direct link or download link).<br>
For
 example,  you may choose to open these files with a media player 
application instead of using the plugin that is set to open it. In such 
cases, your chosen application will be used for file downloads, but, when
 the content type is embedded inside a web page, Pale Moon will continue 
to use the plugin to handle the content type, instead. 
      </p>
The Applications category has limited functionality for editing. You
can change the action for an existing file type but you cannot add or
remove file types. Entries are added automatically when you download
files and select actions for them from the file download dialog box.<br>
