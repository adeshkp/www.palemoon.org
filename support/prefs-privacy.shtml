      <h1>Privacy settings</h1>
      <strong>This preferences page provides Pale Moon settings for
tracking signals, cookies and browsing history.</strong><br>
      
      <h2>Tracking</h2>

      <p>Most major websites track their visitors' behavior and then 
sell or provide that information to other companies.  This information 
can be used to show ads, products or services specifically targeted to 
you. Pale Moon has a <strong>Do Not Track</strong> feature that lets you 
tell every website you visit, their advertisers, and content providers 
that you don't want your browsing behavior tracked. 
      </p>
      <p>Honoring this setting is voluntary - individual websites are
not (yet) legally required to respect it. The setting is an official
way of letting your wishes be known to visited websites but does not
block or remove tracking, nor does it enforce your wishes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Websites that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do</span> honor this setting should 
automatically stop tracking your behavior without any further action 
from you.  Turning on this feature will not affect your ability to log 
in to websites nor cause Pale Moon to forget your private information, 
such as the contents of shopping carts, location information or login 
information.
      </p>
      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>These settings<strong></strong> control how Pale Moon saves information about your web browsing.
      </p>

</li><li> A list of files you download will be kept in the Library window.
</li><li> The text you enter into form fields or the search bar will be 
remembered so you can use those entries again.
</li><li> Pale Moon will accept cookies from sites until they expire.
</li>
      </ul>

      </p>
