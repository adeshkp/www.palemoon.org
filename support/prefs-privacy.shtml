      <h1>Privacy settings</h1>
      <strong>This preferences page provides Pale Moon settings for
tracking signals, cookies and browsing history.</strong><br>
      <h2>Tracking</h2>
      <p>Most major websites track their visitors' behavior and then
sell or provide that information to other companies. This information
can be used to show ads, products or services specifically targeted to
you. Pale Moon has a <strong>Do Not Track</strong> feature that lets
you tell every website you visit, their advertisers, and content
providers that you don't want your browsing behavior tracked. </p>
      <p>Honoring this setting is voluntary - individual websites are
not (yet) legally required to respect it. The setting is an official
way of letting your wishes be known to visited websites but does not
block or remove tracking, nor does it enforce your wishes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Websites that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do</span>
honor this setting should automatically stop tracking your behavior
without any further action from you. Turning on this feature will not
affect your ability to log in to websites nor cause Pale Moon to forget
your private information, such as the contents of shopping carts,
location information or login information. </p>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>These settings<strong></strong> control how Pale Moon saves
information about your web browsing. </p>
      <h3>Remember history</h3>
      <p>When it is <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>set to <strong>Remember

window.
        </li>
        <li> The text you enter into form fields or the search bar will
be remembered so you can use those entries again.
        </li>
        <li> Pale Moon will accept cookies from sites until they
expire.
        </li>
