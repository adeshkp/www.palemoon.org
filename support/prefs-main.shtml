      <h1>Startup, Home page and Downloads</h1>
      <strong>This preferences page provides Pale Moon settings for
browser startup, home page location, and several settings for downloads.</strong><br>
      <br>
      <h2>Browser startup</h2>
      <p>When Pale Moon starts, you can choose from the following
startup behaviors:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Show my home page: This will make the initial page loaded
when the browser starts the home page or pages set below. (default)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Show a blank page: This will make the initial page loaded
when the browser starts an empty document.</li>
        <li>Show my windows and tabs from last time: This will restore
the browser windows and tabs that were open when you ended your
previous browsing session (exited the browser).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Browser home page</h2>
In the Home Page field, you can enter any URL (or multiple, separated
by a pipe | character) that the browser should treat as its home page.
This home page will be used for the Home navigation button, and (if
set) as startup page for browser start.<br>
If you erase the contents of the field, the browser will use an
(internal) home page with some basic functions and a web search bar.<br>
      <br>
The buttons allow you to quickly set the home page field:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Use current page: Sets the field to whatever URL is
currently open in the browser window you opened the Options from.</li>
        <li>Use Bookmark...: Opens a bookmark chooser, allowing you to
pick one of the bookmarks you saved as a home page.</li>
        <li>Restore to default: Resets the home page field to the
default home page as shipped with the browser.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Downloads</h2>
      <p>This section allows you to choose where to save downloaded
files. You can either select a default download location, making
downloads start automatically and downloaded files to always be saved
in the designated folder/directory, or select to have the browser ask
where downloaded files should be saved every time.</p>
      <p>(New in v27): On Windows, files downloaded from the internet
can have specific zone information saved with them to mark the files as
potentially unsafe. You can indicate here whether this zone information
should be saved with downloaded files or not:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Never: The browser will never save zone information with
the downloaded files (they are not marked as downloaded from the
internet).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Always: The browser will always save this information with
downloaded files.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Use system setting: The browser will use whatever the
system-wide setting is for zone information to determine whether to
save this information with downloaded files or not.</li>
      </ul>
Note: Zone information can only be saved on NTFS drives.<br>
