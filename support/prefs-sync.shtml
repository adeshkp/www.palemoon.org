      <h1>Sync preferences</h1>
      <strong>This preferences page provides Pale Moon settings for
the Pale Moon Sync client.</strong><br>
      <h2>When Sync has not been set up yet</h2>When Pale Moon Sync has not been set up yet, this page offers 2 links:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set Up Sync</span>: Set up Pale Moon Sync on this browser</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pair a device</span>: Link the browser to an existing Sync account.</li>
      </ul>
Please see the <a href="http://www.palemoon.org/sync/help/easy-setup.shtml">help page for adding new devices</a> for more information on how this setup procedure works.<br>
      <h2>When Sync is active</h2>

      <p>When Sync is active (it is set up with a user name, password
and key), this page offers various settings to control the operation of
Sync.<br>
</p>
      <h3>Manage Account</h3>
This drop-down menu has a number of options:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>View Quota: This allows you to check how much space you
have in use on the Pale Moon Sync server for each synchronized data
category.</li>
        <li>Change Password: This allows you to change the password on
your Sync account. Entering a new password in the Sync client will
prevent any of your other linked devices from synchronizing until
you've updated the password on those devices as well.</li>
        <li>My Recovery Key: This allows you to view and manage your encryption key for your data. Please see the <a href="http://www.palemoon.org/sync/help/recoverykey.shtml">help page for managing your recovery key</a> for more information.</li>
        <li>Reset Sync: This allows you to remove synchronized data and re-synchronize, in case of issues. You have the choice of:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merge data</span>: This
will remove the data belonging to this device on the server, and
re-send local data, as well as re-fetch data from other devices linked
to your account.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Replace all data on this device</span>: This will remove all local data that is shared between devices (bookmarks/passwords/etc.) and fetch replacements from the Sync server. Any un-synchronized local data will be lost.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Replace all data on other devices</span>:
This will remove all data on the sync server that is shared between
devices and push the local data to the server to replace data on other
devices. Any data on other devices will be overwritten by this local
data next time those devices connect to the Sync server.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>Sync My...</h3>
This determines which items to synchronize between devices.<br>
Any item that is checked will be sent from this browser and fetched
from the server; any unchecked item will have a local, independent copy
of the item.<br>
      <h3>Device Name</h3>
This space is used to give your synchronized browser a unique name on
the Sync server, allowing you to find a device easily for getting a
specific item from a remote, synchronized, device, like an open tab.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Privacy notice</span>: This field is the <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> thing that is sent <span style="font-style: italic;">as-is</span>
to the Sync server and not encrypted in the database (although still
protected by SSL/TLS in transport, of course). If you are worried that
this information might be a privacy issue, then please make sure to
give each synchronized browser instance a unique, cryptic name that
makes sense to you for distinguishing the different browsers, but
doesn't make sense to a random observer.<br>
      <h3>Unlink This Device</h3>
Clicking this link will remove this browser from your Sync account and will stop synchronizing data.<br>
      <br>
You will not lose any local data when you do this; all your history,
bookmarks, passwords, etc. will remain stored as-normal in your
browser, but any changes to this data will no longer be sent to the
server, nor be available on other devices from that point forward.<br>
      <h3>Terms of Service/Privacy policy<br>
      </h3>
      <p>These links allow you to open up a page with the Terms of
Service and Privacy Policy of the sync server you currently have in
use.This will be dependent on whether you use the Pale Moon Sync server or a different (custom) sync server operated by someone else. <br>
