      <h1>Advanced preferences: Network</h1>
      <strong>This preferences tab provides advanced Pale Moon settings for network connections and caching.</strong><br>
      <h2>Connection</h2>
      <p>This
allows you to configure how Pale Moon connects to the internet.
Clicking the button will open an advanced connection settings dialog:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Configure Proxies to Access the Internet:<br>
One of five possible options:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>No proxy: All connections are made directly to the server.</li>
          <li>Auto-detect proxy settings: Pale Moon will attempt to
determine the required connectivity settings for proxies automatically
(either through a system proxy or direct connections).</li>
          <li>Use system proxy settings: Use whatever proxy is set up in the operating system for Internet connectivity.</li>
          <li>Manual proxy configuration: You enter proxy addresses and
ports yourself. Please see the documentation or instructions given to
you (usually by IT staff) what to enter in which location if you need
this option.</li>
          <li>Automatic proxy configuration URL: Enter the URL here of
the proxy configuration file (.pac) you need to use. Please also see
the relevant instructions or documentation given to you for this option.</li>
        </ul>
</ul><h2>Cached Web Content</h2>By default, Pale Moon will store
downloaded pages and content in its web cache for quick access without
having to re-download data for pages on subsequent visits. This section
informs you how much disk space is being used for this cached web
content, and allows you to empty the cache and control its size.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Clear Now</span> (button): This will empty the cache and remove all stored web content from disk.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Override automatic cache management</span>:
If you check this box, you can manually enter a maximum amount of disk
space to use for cached web content. If unchecked, the browser will use
default values up to a certain maximum based on your system
specifications and available disk space.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Limit cache to</span>: When manually setting the cache size, use no more than this amount of disk space for cache web content.<br>
<h2>Offline Web Content and User Data</h2>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Web
applications can store user data in your browser, and in some
situations tell the browser to cache specific content so the web
application can still be used even if you are off-line.<br>
      <br>
This section will tell you how much data is being stored on disk for
this purpose, and give you control over which sites are allowed to
store this data.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Clear Now</span> (button): This
will immediately clear stored user data and off-line web content.
Please note that using this button, you may lose specific
options/results stored in your browser by websites.<br>
Pale Moon up to v27.1.1:<br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell me when a website asks to store data for off-line use:</span> Controls how the browser responds to websites asking to store this kind fo data:<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Checked</span>: You will be prompted by the browser to allow storage of data (unless it's in the exceptions)<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Unchecked</span>: Storage of data is always denied<br>
      </div>

      Pale Moon from v27.2 onwards:<br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">When a website asks to store data for off-line use:</span><br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Allow by default</span>: Storage of user data and offline web content is allowed without prompting (default), unless it's in the exceptions.<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Always ask</span>: You will be prompted by the browser to allow storage of data (unless it's in the exceptions)<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Deny</span>: Never allow storage of user data of off-line web content. Not recommended; this will break some web applications.<br>
      </div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exceptions</span> (button): Opens a list with websites for which you have told the browser to block storage.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Section with user data storage entries</span>: Shows a list of domains which have data stored in the browser. You can select and remove the data for individual entries.<br>
