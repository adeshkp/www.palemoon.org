      <h1>Security and Passwords</h1>
      <strong>This preferences page provides Pale Moon settings for
various security features and stored passwords.</strong><br>
      <h2>Add-ons</h2>
      <p><strong>Warn me when sites try to install add-ons</strong>:
Pale Moon will always ask you to confirm installations of add-ons. To
prevent unrequested installation prompts which may lead to accidental
installations, Pale Moon warns you when a website tries to install an
add-on and blocks the installation prompt. To allow installations from
a specific site, click <span style="font-style: italic;" class="button">Exceptions…</span>,
enter the site name, and click <span style="font-style: italic;"
 class="button">Allow</span>. Uncheck this to disable the extra warning
for all sites. <br>
      </p>
      <h2>Passwords</h2>
If you store passwords in the browser, it is strongly recommended that
you set and use a master password.<br>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Remember passwords for sites</strong>: Pale Moon
can securely save passwords you enter in web forms to make it easier to
log on to websites. Clear this checkbox to prevent Pale Moon from
remembering your passwords.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Even with this
checked, you will still be asked whether to save specific passwords for
a site when you first visit it. If you select <span
 style="font-style: italic;" class="button">Never for This Site</span>,
that site will be added to an exceptions list. To access this list or
to remove sites from it, click the <span style="font-style: italic;"
 class="button">Exceptions…</span> button.
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Use a master password</strong>: Pale Moon can
protect
sensitive information such as saved passwords and certificates by
encrypting them using a master password. If you create a master
password, each time you start a new browsing session, Pale Moon will
ask you to enter the password the first time it needs to access a
certificate or stored password (including when Sync is used).<br>
You can set, change, or remove the master password by checking or
unchecking this <span class="for" data-for="win">option</span> or by
clicking the <span style="font-style: italic;" class="button">Change
Master Password…</span>
button. If a master password is already set, you will need to enter the
current master password in order to change or remove it, as a security
measure.
        </li>
        <li> You can manage saved passwords and view or delete
individual passwords by clicking the <span style="font-style: italic;"
 class="button">Saved Passwords…</span> button.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Security protocols</h2>
These settings allow you to control the use of some security protocols:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enable Strict Transport
Security (HSTS)</span>: This enables or disables the use of HTTP Strict
Transport Security, a mechanism for websites to indicate that browsers
should always connect to them using https (even on first connect). This
is a security vs. privacy trade-off, because it will be possible to
determine which HSTS sites have been visited before when this is
enabled.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enable Certificate Key
Pinning (HPKP)</span>: this enables or disables the use of <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning">HTTP
Public Key Pinning</a>, which is a security feature that tells a web
client to associate a specific cryptographic public key with a certain
web server to decrease the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks with
forged certificates. HPKP has the potential to lock out users for a
long time if used incorrectly, at which point disabling it in the
browser is the only workaround.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>XSS Filter</h2>
      <p style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Pale Moon version 26.* only.</p>
      <p>This checkbox enables the active XSS (Cross-site scripting)
filter present in Pale Moon v26. Please see the forum for more
information about this filter.<br>
Due to technical limitations and stability concerns (browser crashes),
this filter is not implemented in v27 any longer.<br>
