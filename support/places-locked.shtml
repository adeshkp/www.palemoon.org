      <h1>The bookmarks and history system will not be functional</h1>
      <strong>The bookmarks and history system will not be functional
because one of Firefox's files is in use by another application. Some
security software can cause this problem.</strong><br>
      <p>This happens when the file that stores your bookmarks and
browsing history (named <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">places.sqlite</span>)
can&#8217;t be accessed by Pale Moon. This page covers two possible solutions.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Solution 1: restart your computer</h3>
The most common causes of this error are another program using the file
or a problem with the file that was caused when the computer was shut
off unexpectedly (like a power failure). The good news is that most of
the time, simply restarting your computer and then restarting Pale Moon
is the fix for both problems. You may also want to perform a disk check
(check disk for errors) to see if there is a problem with the actual
file and repair it.<br>
      <h3>Solution 2: create a new places database</h3>
If restarting your computer doesn&#8217;t take care of things, you can fix
this by having Pale Moon create a new places database for you.<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the Pale Moon button, click Help and select
Troubleshooting Information. The Troubleshooting Information page will
now open.</li>
        <li>Under the Application Basics section, click on Show Folder
next to "Profile Folder". A file manager window with your profile files
will open.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Leave the Profile folder
open</span>.</li>
        <li>Click the Pale Moon button and then click Exit. Wait until
Pale Moon has completely quit.</li>
        <li>In the Pale Moon profile folder from step 2, find and
rename the files <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">places.sqlite</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">places.sqlite-journal</span>
(if it exists).</li>
        <li>Reopen Pale Moon.</li>
      </ol>
When Pale Moon reopens it will create a new places database.<br>
Your browsing history will be lost, but Pale Moon will automatically
import your bookmarks from the most recent backup file.<br>
      <br>
If your bookmarks weren&#8217;t restored after creating a new places
database, the following MozillaZine KB article may help: <a

      <h2>Help! This didn&#8217;t fix the problem.</h2>
This problem has symptoms that are similar to a number of other
problems, that are beyond this simple help page.<br>
It's suggested that you ask for help on our <a
 href="https://forum.palemoon.org/">forum</a> to find the cause and
potential solutions.<br>
