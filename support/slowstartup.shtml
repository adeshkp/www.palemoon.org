      <h1>Slow startup detected</h1>
      <strong>It seems that Pale Moon is taking much longer than normal to start.</strong><br>
      <br>
      <h2>What happened?</h2>
      <p>Pale
Moon, as part of normal monitoring of its process, has detected that
starting the browser is taking much longer than it should. This can
have multiple reasons:<br>
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your computer is very busy due to other running programs, slowing the start of Pale Moon.</li>
        <li>Your computer is low on memory.</li>
        <li>There is a problem with your session store (saved windows and tabs from last time) causing a large delay.</li>
        <li>There is a problem with one or more extensions, delaying the startup of the browser.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
 
      <h2>What can I do to fix this?</h2>
      <p>If you run into this regularly, you should examine what the cause is using the above points.<br>
If your computer is low on memory, considering adding more memory or closing resident programs.<br>
If there is a delay because you are using a very large number of tabs, consider using bookmarks instead.<br>
Examine your extensions and check for any incompatibilities.<br>
</p>
      <p>You can also try to give Pale Moon a fresh start with your
data by performing a profile reset. To do this, go to Help -&gt;
troubleshooting information... and use the "Reset" button top-right, if
present. In some situations this button may nor be present, in which case you should create a fresh profile; for more assistance with that, please visit our <a href="https://forum.palemoon.org/">community forum</a>.<br>
