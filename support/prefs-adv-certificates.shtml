      <h1>Advanced preferences: Certificates</h1>
      <strong>This preferences tab provides advanced Pale Moon settings
for SSL/TLS certificates.</strong><br>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Personal Certificate</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">When a server requests my
personal certificate</span>: Some servers ask you to identify yourself
with a personal certificate. In order to do so, they ask the browser to
generate one for you or install one. When you visit the site in the
future, Pale Moon will ask you for which certificate to use.<br>
If you wish to have Pale Moon automatically choose a certificate for
you, select the Select one automatically setting.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: A personal
certificate can contain personally identifiable
information, such as your name or address. It may therefore harm your
privacy if you select the <span style="font-style: italic;">Select one
automatically</span> setting. If you do,
you will not be alerted when a website request your personal
certificate, and you may lose the ability to control who can access
your personal information.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Certificate Validation</h2>
You will most likely only need to change these settings if your
Internet environment specifically requires it.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Query OCSP responder servers to
confirm the current validity of certificates</span>: As part of normal
validation checks on SSL/TLS certificates, Pale Moon may ask an OCSP
(Online Certificate Status Protocol) server to confirm that a
certificate is still valid and has not been revoked by its issuer. By
default, Pale Moon validates a certificate if the certificate provides
an OCSP server.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">When an OCSP server connection
fails, treat the certificate as invalid</span>: If a certificate
provides an OCSP server, and the browser is for any reason not able to
contact the OCSP server (e.g. due to routing, server load, or other
connectivity issues with the OCSP server), Pale Moon will refuse the
connection to the website you're trying to visit. There are many
reasons why you won't be able to contact an OCSP server at any given
time, so only enable this if you are at specific risk of enountering
wrongly-issued and revoked certificates.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Other controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">View Certificates</span>:
Click this button to view stored certificates, import new certificates,
and back up or delete old certificates in Pale Moon.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Security Devices</span>:
Security devices can encrypt and decrypt connections and store
certificates and passwords. If you need to use a security device other
than the one built into Pale Moon, click the Security Devices button.</li>
