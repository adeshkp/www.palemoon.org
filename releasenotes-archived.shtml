      <h1>Release notes for version 27 releases</h1>
      <h3>27.3.0 (2017-04-28)</h3>
A major development update. Many things have changed in the media
back-end, but please understand that some things are still a work in
progress, and you may still encounter some html5 video playback issues
with MSE.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed up, checked and enabled vertical text writing modes!<br>
Pale Moon will now be able to display vertical, right-to-left script.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added the option to reset non-default profiles.</li>
        <li>Fixed various issues in the WebP image decoder.</li>
        <li>Added internally-supported document types to allowed <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code>
types.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed locale selection in ICU after update to ICU58.<br>
(Note: Pale
Moon uses the system locale for date formatting, not the browser locale)</li>
        <li>Re-implemented the previous spellchecker dictionary logic
(allow user override of document/element language, improve logic and
make it unambiguous).</li>
        <li>Ongoing fixes for the MP4 parser and MSE.</li>
        <li>Made HTML Media Elements' preload attribute MSE-spec
compliant.<br>
The preload attribute on HTML media elements is now ignored in the case
of an MSE source. This prevents an issue with sourceopen not firing
when preload="none".</li>
        <li>Fixed some issues with Windows WMF media playback.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with Synced preferences sometimes
overwriting stored individual preferences.</li>
        <li>Fixed display of RSS folder icons.</li>
        <li>Fixed issues with custom context menus.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue importing bookmarks with separators losing
their extra data.</li>
        <li>Changed the way numeric addresses are handled in the
address bar so it doesn't perform a search when it shouldn't.</li>
        <li>Added an option (<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">browser.sessionstore.cache_behavior</span>)
to
control from which source restored tabs pull their page content:<br>
0 = load restored tab data from cache (current behavior, default)<br>
1 = refresh restored tab data from the network<br>
2 = refresh stored tab data from the network and bypass any cached data.</li>
        <li>Improved upon a v27 performance regression with SVG scaling.</li>
        <li>Improved performance by being more selective which CSS
animations to process.<br>
As a side-effect, elements changing their display from "none" to
something visible now also animate.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Increased memory allocation for the use of very large PAC
files.</li>
        <li>Added menu entries for the permissions manager and
improvements to its function and display.</li>
        <li>Added preferences to control "highlight all" behavior of
the find bar:<br>
          <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">accessibility.typeaheadfind.highlightallbydefault</span>
= true/false
highlight all found words by default.<br>
          <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">accessibility.typeaheadfind.highlightallremember</span>
= true/false remember
the last-used state of Highlight All.</li>
        <li>Added devtools command-line options.</li>
        <li>Added remote IP and protocol to Devtools-&gt;Network entry
details.</li>
        <li>Added support for <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>
HTML
tags.</li>
        <li>Fixed a regression in the MSIE profile migrator.</li>
        <li>Removed migration of browser-specific settings when
migrating data from IE/Safari.</li>
        <li>Implemented optional parameters for permessage-deflate in
preparation for RFC7692 errata making acceptance of them mandatory (and
to prevent web compat issues due to the current conflicting text of it).</li>
        <li>Made the image document favicon skinnable. </li>
        <li>Aligned DOM selection addRange with the spec.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Exposed mozAnon constructor js binding to system scopes for
XHR.</li>
        <li>Enhanced form data handling from JavaScript.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security/privacy changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated NSS to 3.28.4-RTM to address a number of issues.</li>
        <li>Added support for RSA-AES(-GCM)-SHA256/384 suites to
broaden compatibility.</li>
        <li>Reconfigured networking security: disabled static DHE
suites by default, enabled all RSA-AES(-GCM)-SHA256/384 suites in their
stead.</li>
        <li>Fixed referrer policy keyword to align with the current
spec ("cross-origin" vs "crossorigin").</li>
        <li>Added an option to display punycode domain for IDN websites
to combat phishing.<br>
This is enabled by default for domain-validated https sites.<br>
Preference: <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">browser.identity.display_punycode</span><br>
0 = Display IDN name in identity panel (previous behavior)<br>
1 = Display punycode name for DV SSL domains (default)<br>
2 = Also display punycode for HTTP sites if IDN name used</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue to prevent contacting remote servers when a
connection might get blocked.</li>
        <li>Fixed 3 public security flaws in libevent, which may affect
Mozilla-based products. <span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span></li>

      </ul>
      <h3>27.2.1 (2017-03-24)</h3>
This is a small update to fix some stability and usability issues.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed an issue with planar alpha handling (transparency)
when drawing JXR images.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash related to a change JavaScript array handling
introduced in 27.2.0.<br>
This became apparent with the pentadactyl extension, but could happen
in other situations as well.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash when opening ridiculously large images with
HQ scaling enabled (default).<br>
Pale Moon will now only apply HQ scaling for images within reasonable
limits (64 Mpix or smaller). Images larger than that may not display
properly when zooming in, or may not display at all, even scaled down
(e.g. &gt;256 Mpix large) and show a "broken image" placeholder
instead; please use dedicated image viewer applications for those kinds
of images; it is outside the scope of a web browser to handle such
large images.</li>
        <li>Changed the way URL hashes are handled, and will no longer
%-decode anchor hash identifiers by default.<br>
Note that this is against RFC 3986, which states that any part of the
URL scheme that isn't data should be decoded.<br>
This is required for web compatibility because several sites use hash
links to pass actual data to web applications (Please don't do this!
Hashes ar part of the URL address, should only consist of "safe"
characters, and aren't suited to pass arbitrary data) and the most
common browsers no longer follow the RFC in that respect.<br>
If you want RFC compliance, switch <strong><em><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">dom.url.getters_decode_hash</span></em></strong>
to <strong><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">true</span></em></strong></li>
        <li>Restored 2 RSA Camellia cipher suites that were missing:
TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA and TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with custom toolbars getting deleted during
upgrade from 27.0/27.1 to 27.2</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.2.0 (2017-03-18)</h3>
This is a major update to the browser with a focus on back-end
improvements and security.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/Fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated the ICU lib to 58.2 to fix a number of issues.</li>
        <li>Added proper control for the user for offline storage for
web applications.</li>
        <li>Added a check to prevent auto-filled URLs from copying the
auto-filled selection to clipboard/primary.</li>
        <li>Added the feature to pass a URL to open in a private window
from the command-line.</li>
        <li>Improved the display of the downloads indicator on the
button in bright-text situations.<br>
        </li>
        <li>DOM storage now honors the "3rd party cookie" setting in
that it will not allow 3rd party data to be stored if 3rd party cookies
are disallowed.</li>
        <li>Allowed toolbar button badges to be properly styled.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the hunspell spellchecking library to 1.6.0 to fix
a number of issues.</li>
        <li>Fixed desktop notifications being off-screen if fired in
rapid succession.</li>
        <li>Added Element.insertAdjacentElement and
Element.insertAdjacentText DOM functions.</li>
        <li>Added support for JPEG-XR images.<br>
This makes Pale Moon have the broadest support for image formats of all
web browsers.<br>
(enabled by default; you can disable this with <span
 style="font-style: italic;">media.jxr.enabled</span>).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Completely removed the use of GStreamer on Linux.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added support for element.innerText.</li>
        <li>Custom toolbars should now properly remember their state.</li>
        <li>Fixed some more playback issues with MP4/MSE videos.<br>
Please be aware that we are still working on further improving MSE
video handling.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Changed media processing to reduce dangerous processing
asynchronicity.<br>
This should also make media elements and playback more responsive.</li>
        <li>Fixed a useragent string regression always displaying the
minor Goanna version as .0</li>
        <li>Updated NSPR to 4.13.1.</li>
        <li>Updated NSS to 3.28.3-RTM.</li>
        <li>Fixed unrestricted icon sizes in PMkit buttons.</li>
        <li>Fixed unresponsive buttons on support page when not
building the updater.</li>
        <li>Fixed the use of "View image" and "Save image as" on
extremely large images.</li>
        <li>Changed the way "View Image" and "Save image as" work on
canvas elements.</li>
        <li>Made checking for dangerously large resolution PNG images
smarter.<br>
It will now accept larger "strip"-aspect ratio images while reducing
unsupported large image resolutions.<br>
This will e.g. fix Gmail's "emoji" window that uses a ridiculously long
but very narrow single image to store all the emoticon pictures.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Converted several hard-coded URLs to preferences.</li>
        <li>Updated the google.com override so it would not cripple
services based on UA sniffing.</li>
        <li>Added Inner and Outer Window ID administration.</li>
        <li>Fixed the add-on discovery pane detection.</li>
        <li>Added support for canvas ellipse.</li>
        <li>Improved drawing of certain MathML elements at problematic
zoom levels.</li>
        <li>No longer building gamepad support.</li>
        <li>Updated Harfbuzz font shaper to 1.4.3 to fix a number of
issues.</li>
        <li>Fixed a number of crashes (layout, plugins, uncommon
navigation, bad URLs).</li>
        <li>Aligned SVG specular filters with the spec.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security/privacy changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added support for 256-bit AES-GCM encryption.</li>
        <li>Added support for ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption.</li>
        <li>Removed support for Camellia-GCM since nobody seems
interested in it.<br>
(Camellia in 128/256-bit CBC block mode is still fully supported).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added support for SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 to
Crypto utils.</li>
        <li>Improved status handling of secure sites to be less
sensitive to "insecure" items that are local.</li>
        <li>Fixed print preview hijacking. (CVE-2017-5421)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potentially exploitable crash in OnStartRequest.
(CVE-2017-5416)</li>
        <li>Fixed potential cross-origin content-stealing through a
timing attack. (CVE-2017-5407) <span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed a denial-of-service problem with view-source.
(CVE-2017-5422)</li>
        <li>Fixed crash in directional controls. (CVE-2017-5413)</li>
        <li>Fixed a perceived problem with chrome manifests.
(CVE-2017-5427)</li>
        <li>Fixed the use of an uninitialized value. (CVE-2017-5405)</li>
        <li>Fixed a buffer overflow. (CVE-2017-5412)</li>
        <li>Fixed a UAF situation. (CVE-2017-5403)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential spoofing issue with the address bar.
(CVE-2017-5417)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential issue in libvpx. (CVE-2017-5402) <span
 style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed a potential issue with HTTP auth. (CVE-2017-5418)</li>
        <li>Fixed several memory safety hazards and potentially
exploitable crashes. <span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);"></span>
      <h3>27.1.2 (2017-03-03)</h3>
This is a small update adding a workaround for potential deadlocks
happening in media elements.<br>
      <h3>27.1.1 (2017-02-21)</h3>
This is a stability and bugfix update to the browser.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/Fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented a fix in media handling to prevent crashes with
concurrent videos and/or rapidly starting/stopping video playback in
the browser.</li>
        <li>Fixed the way the Adobe Flash plugin is detected to prevent
confusion with other plugins that identify themselves as "Flash" (e.g.
VLC).</li>
        <li>Windows: Solved stability issues caused by the release
build process, resulting in unexpected behavior (e.g. hangups).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.1.0 (2017-02-09)</h3>
This
is a major update with lots of development and bugfixes. It also
introduces the so-called "PMkit" modules, our effort to restore
compatibility with Jetpack/SDK extensions and making it possible for
extension developers to convert their SDK extensions with little effort
to a Pale Moon compatible format. For more details please <a
 href="http://developer.palemoon.org/Add-ons:Extensions/Jetpack">check
the PMkit documentation</a> on the developer wiki.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Changes/Fixes:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Reworked the media back-end completely (thanks Travis!) to
use FFmpeg (including support for FFmpeg v3 and MP3 playback) and our
own MP4 parser, and no longer relying on gstreamer on Linux, as well as
adding some improvements on Windows for media parsing and playing.</li>
        <li>On
Linux, Apple .mov files of the correct type will also be played through
FFmpeg now, for those rare occasions where they are still in use,
considering there is no Quicktime plug-in available on that operating
system.</li>
        <li>Restored the classic about:config styling.</li>
        <li>Added a fallback to US-ASCII if the autoconfig UTF-8
conversion fails.</li>
        <li>Improved cross-compartment wrapper handling when managing a
large number of tabs (fixes a performance regression with v27).</li>
        <li>Changed the way audio and video synchronization is
calculated to account for (slow) device latency, preventing things from
getting out of sync on e.g. BlueTooth-connected speakers.</li>
        <li>Changed the way scripts are handled when they are stopped
from the "unresponsive script" dialog, to prevent browser lockup. We
will now stop all scripts in the affected compartment in one go.</li>
        <li>Fixed several errors in the devtools.</li>
        <li>Fixed a nasty crash caused by cross-origin referrers.</li>
        <li>Fixed the installer to allow 64-bit versions of the browser
to be installed on Vista again.</li>
        <li>Added HTML5-spec clipboard handling for content
(cut&amp;copy only -- paste is not allowed for security reasons).</li>
        <li>Made multiple changes to the toolkit jetpack modules to
cater to PMkit extensions.<br>
This
should make running SDK-based modules as PMkit extensions fairly simple
for extension developers. See the introductory text to these release
notes.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a css layout issue: make max-width affect
contributions to intrinsic min-width.</li>
        <li>Implemented several updates to the permissions manager.
Among others, Improved the permissions manager (about:permissions) with
a more complete set of permissions for pages.</li>
        <li>Removed otherwise unused Metro browser platform/widget code.</li>
        <li>Removed support for non-standard/deprecated let blocks and
expressions.</li>
        <li>Made the use of let as a keyword versionless and ES6
compliant.</li>
        <li>Made the privacy category in preferences a tabbed setup to
better fit the current options.</li>
        <li>Fixed a regression preventing certain MP4 video files from
playing.</li>
        <li>Fixed a regression where seeking in media files would halt
playback/jump to the end of the stream.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash caused by certain downloadable fonts with
DirectWrite in use.</li>
        <li>Improved downloads-button indicator legibility on some
combinations of Windows versions and system theme colors.</li>
        <li>Changed the Facebook user-agent override to be our native
one, based on reports from users that it is (finally) working
acceptably.</li>
        <li>Fixed site-specific useragents being ignored if a global
override is defined.</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Security/privacy changes:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed CORS handling to allow data: sources, assuming they
are same-origin. This should fix the infamous "Facebook endless reload"
issue and may make some other sites that assume this particular

the "tabs not loading their contents" issue when migrating a profile
and some other situations).</li>
        <li>Disabled downloadable font unicode-ranges on non-Windows
platforms.</li>
        <li>Added a Google Fonts user-agent override for non-Windows
platforms so they don't send unicode-ranged composite fonts (Feature
detection? Google apparently still doesn't know what that is).</li>
        <li>Re-enabled the reporting of CSS errors to the console by

        <li>Fixed a layout regression that would cause block elements
following left floats to not wrap to the next line if there wasn't
enough clearance.</li>

      <h3>27.0.2 (2016-12-02)</h3>
This is a minor update to address usability and security issues:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabled Firefox
Compatibility mode by default for the useragent string.</span><br>
Unfortunately
too many websites (and especially the big players who should know
better like Google, Apple and Microsoft) still require the "we must
pretend to
be Firefox if we want this site to work" status quo to be
maintained, because people still insist on using useragent sniffing to
determine "browser features", or even worse, discriminate against free
choice of browser by flat-out refusing service (I'm looking at you,
banking industry and cloud services!) when visiting websites just
because companies don't
want to provide assistance to any but users on the main 3.<br>
          <span style="font-style: italic;">HTML offers plenty of ways
to do proper feature detection; site owners should use them.</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
          <span style="font-style: italic;">Seriously people, it was a
bad idea 20 years ago, and it's a worse idea in 2016.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The built-in devtools are
back, and with a facelift!</span><br>
Thanks to some consistent community help, the built-in devtools, sorely
missed by a number of our users, are back. They've received a code and
style update and should be fully functional on the new platform. This
was originally planned for 27.1, but it was decided to include this as
soon as possible, not in the least to assist extension developers in
their efforts to adapt to Pale Moon 27.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fix:</span><br>
Fixed a crash in SVG, related to <span id="summary_alias_container"><span
 id="alias_nonedit_display">CVE-2016-9079</span>, as a defense-in-depth
measure</span>.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.0.1 (2016-11-28)</h3>
This is a bugfix release for some of the issues that popped up with the
new milestone.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed removal of distribution/bundles/ copies of status bar
code and ruby annotations code.<br>
This should clean up everything on install/upgrade that currently
causes double code to create intermittent/odd behavior.</li>
        <li>Backed out some media back-end changes to fix MSE playback
on Twitch.tv and other similar sites.</li>
        <li>Disabled pop-up network status in full screen by default
(since video detection is rather iffy at the moment).</li>
        <li>Fixed a regression causing the "reset profile" button to
not appear in about:support on the default profile.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Worked around bad Netflix interface changes - it will now
use a more compatible web UI.<br>
Please note that these Netflix changes were unrelated to the actual
release of Pale Moon (26.5 is also affected).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Aligned base status bar colors with default prefs.</li>
        <li>Fixed status bar options not being remembered.</li>
        <li>Added
an override for Amazon Prime videos so they won't stop us at the front
door any longer when not using the Firefox Compatibility user agent
mode.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Re-applied proper branding text to in-app licensing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.0.0 (2016-11-22)</h3>
After about 8 months of development, we now have a new milestone
release with literally too many changes to list even concisely. These
release notes will therefore only highlight the most important parts of
this release.<br>
In this release we've done a full upgrade of our back-end platform,
meaning many things work different "under the hood" and you may run
into a number of extension compatibility issues as a result.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">New and updated features:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Support for DirectX 11 and Direct2d 1.1 on Windows. This
will bring Pale Moon more in line with the capabilities for current-day
operating systems and graphics hardware.</li>
        <li>Update of the Goanna engine to 3.0 - with many changes to
layout and rendering for the modern web.</li>
        <li>Pale Moon now fully supports HTTP/2.</li>
        <li>Ruby Annotations are now an integral part of the HTML
parser, controllable with CSS.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Media Source Extensions have been implemented to solve many
video playback issues.<br>
This can be enabled/disabled and configured in Options. It's
recommended at this time to not enable MSE for WebM since there are a
few issues with it on services like YouTube (e.g. losing audio when
looping/skipping).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Support for reading and playing so-called "fragmented" MP4
files has been added, further solving media playback issues.</li>
        <li>Support for SSL/TLS connections to proxy servers.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Support for the WOFF2 font format for downloadable fonts.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The
JavaScript engine has been updated with support for
many landmark ECMAScript6 features (chief among them promises and
generators). This will solve many of the web compatibility issues that
people have started to run into in the past few months (e.g. webmail
interfaces, some sites coming up blank because they are
script-generated).</li>
        <li>The way web content is cached has been changed to be more
efficient. If you want to immediately take advantage of this, clear
your cache.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Removed support/features:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed support for Windows XP. If you are still running
Windows XP, then your only option is to continue using Pale Moon 26.</li>
        <li>Removed the internal PDF (pre)viewer. This module was not
maintained, was unable to display even half of the PDF documents
correctly, and could not reasonably remain included in the browser.
Please use a separate reader and/or install a PDF reader plugin.</li>
        <li>Disabled building of the devtools. They will not be
included in release versions of Pale Moon from this point forward. If
you are a web developer or otherwise need those tools, fear not! They
are available as a <a
 href="https://addons.palemoon.org/extensions/devtools/" target="_blank">browser
extension</a>.</li>
        <li>Removed the active XSS filter. This feature, although
effective, was prone to some instability and needs to be rewritten for
the update of our platform. It may or may not return in the future,
depending on whether the original author has time to rewrite parts of
this filter implementation.</li>
        <li>Removed support for Add-on SDK extensions (JetPack
extensions), considering the Mozilla/Gecko SDK is no longer compatible
with our combination of application and platform code.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security highlights:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>All relevant security fixes up to and including Firefox 50
have been ported across from Mozilla to continue to provide an as
secure as possible browser.</li>
        <li>Several libraries have been updated to their latest
versions to pick up any important vulnerability fixes.</li>
        <li>There's a new option and control to determine whether to
save zone information (marking files as "downloaded from the Internet")
on downloaded files (Windows+NTFS). You can find this in Options.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other important notes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>When
first upgrading your browser to v27, your profile will be migrated to
the new format for the browser. This is a one-time conversion and
unfortunately this migration can cause some issues. Please see the <a
 href="https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=13804">forum FAQ</a>
for more details.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Pale Moon 27 will initially only be available in English.
We are working on getting localization done to have language packs
available over time.<br>
Important: You can not use the previous language packs since
many strings have changed. Trying to do so will likely prevent the
browser from starting or functioning. Pale Moon will automatically
disable language packs for the previous version, but if you have
explicitly disabled add-on compatibility checking you may run into
trouble.</li>
        <li>We will continue to fully support the following:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>NPAPI plugins</li>
          <li>Extensions with binary/XPCOM components</li>
          <li>XUL/Overlay and bootstrapped extensions<br>
          </li>
          <li>Complete themes</li>
          <li>Unsigned and author-signed extensions</li>
          <li>The <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_%28cipher%29">Camellia</a>
encryption cipher (also in <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode">GCM</a> mode)<br>
          </li>
          <li>Graphite font shaping</li>
          <li>Sync 1.1 (albeit without support for syncing add-ons)</li>
          <li>Full customization of the UI as before</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h1>Release notes for version 26 releases</h1>
      <h3>26.5.0 (2016-09-28)</h3>
      <strong>Fixes/Changes:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented a breaking CSP (content security policy) spec
change; when a page with CSP is loaded over http, Pale Moon now
interprets CSP directives to also include https versions of the hosts
listed in CSP if a scheme (http/https) isn't explicitly listed. This
breaks with CSP 1.0 which is more restrictive and doesn't allow this
cross-protocol access, but is in line with CSP 2 where this is allowed.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with the XML parser where it would sometimes
end up in an unknown state and throw an error (e.g. when specific
networking errors would occur).</li>
        <li>Improved the performance of canvas poisoning by explicitly
parallelizing it.</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Security fixes:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a potentially exploitable crash related to text
writing direction. (CVE-2016-5280)</li>
        <li>Made checking for invalid PNG files more strict. Pale Moon
will now reject more PNG files that have corrupted/invalid data that
could otherwise lead to potential security issues.</li>
        <li>Changed the way paletted image frames are allocated so the
space is cleared before it's used. <span
 style="color: rgb(128, 128, 0);">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed a crash in nsNodeUtils::CloneAndAdopt() due to a
typo. <span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 0);">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed several memory safety issues and crashes.</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c7">DiD</span> This means that the fix is
"Defense-in-Depth": It is a fix that does not apply to an actively
exploitable vulnerability in Pale Moon, but prevents future
vulnerabilities caused by the same code when surrounding code changes,
exposing the problem.
      <h3>26.4.1 (2016-09-12)</h3>
This is a minor bugfix and security release.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Changes/fixes:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a crash in the XSS filter.</li>
        <li>Slightly changed the address bar shading on secure sites to
be more subtle and easily-blended.</li>
        <li>Fixed the occurrence of "null" titles in bookmarks dragged
from special folders.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error initializing the browser due to trying to
restore scratchpad data from a stored session when having switched from
a version with devtools to a version without devtools, and the previous
version had scratchpad data saved.</li>
        <li>Fixed some minor issues in scratchpad and gcli devtools.</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Security fixes:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated the HSTS preload list to a much more updated source
list,
and performing our own checks on validity from now on to have the list
be as accurate as possible.</li>
        <li>Disabled Triple-DES cipher suites by default (mitigating
SWEET32).</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Portable-only:</span> Changed
the behavior to, by default, allow it to start a new copy or multiple
copies without checking if Pale Moon is already running on the system.
You will need separate profiles to run multiple browsers concurrently.<br>
      <h3>26.4.0.1 (2016-08-23) - Linux only</h3>
This Linux-only release is once again using GStreamer 0.10 for video
support, which should prevent Pale Moon from crashing when playing some
HTML5 videos.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Additional changes/fixes:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>A blacklist for GStreamer has been implemented and enabled
by default (can be disabled with the media.gstreamer.enable-blacklist
about:config pref).</li>
        <li>The flump3dec GStreamer plugin (known to be crashy) &amp;
h264parser element (a potential security risk) have been blacklisted.</li>
        <li>Fixed a couple other GStreamer related crashes.</li>
        <li>No longer force Link Time Optimization with GCC 6</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>26.4.0 (2016-08-17)</h3>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed
Google Search as a bundled search provider. If desired, you can
manually install it (or other search engines) after the update by
following the steps in the <a
 href="http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=12788"
 target="_blank">Manage Search Engines</a> topic.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the URL API to allow "stringification" of the object
per specification. This should make a number of websites happy.</li>
        <li>Added the ES6 string <span style="color: rgb(64, 64, 128);">.includes()</span>
function in addition to the pre-existing <span
 style="color: rgb(64, 64, 128);">.contains()</span> function for
checking if a string contains another string. The <span
 style="color: rgb(64, 64, 128);">.contains()</span>
function is retained for compatibility with web and extension scripts
that adhere to the ES6 pre-release specification up to and including
RC3.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the calculation of standalone SVG embeds width and
height, which should solve some reported issues with html5 graphs being
displayed incorrectly.</li>
        <li>Linux: improved memory allocation.</li>
        <li>Updated the graphite font library to 1.3.9.</li>
        <li>Added a blocking rule for F-Secure's 64-bit deepguard
library to prevent crashes.</li>
        <li>Updated the SQLite library to 3.13.0.</li>
        <li>Download= properties of links are now honored from the
context menu "Save" option.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash in the XSS filter.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash in the DOM error module.</li>
        <li>Worked around a crash on Linux</li>
        <li>Linux:
Improved optimization and GCC6 compatibility (Note: compiling with GCC
6 is still not recommended and it may or may not work, depending on
your environment)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>(CVE-2016-5251)Potential URL spoofing in the address bar.</li>
        <li>(CVE-2016-0718) Context-dependent crash in expat 2.1.0.</li>
        <li>(CVE-2016-5266) Outgoing dataTransfer items are not
properly filtered.</li>
        <li>Fixed potentially exploitable crash in the array splice
implementation.</li>
        <li>Fixed potentially exploitable crash caused by badly
formatted ICO files.</li>
        <li>(CVE-2016-5254) Heap-use-after-free in
nsXULPopupManager::KeyDown</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>26.3.3 (2016-07-01)</h3>
Another
small bugfix update to address some breaking issues. Sorry for the
rapid-fire releases, everyone; this is not our intention.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed an additional issue found that could cause menu text
on Windows 10 to be white-on-white (and therefore unreadable).</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with news feeds not showing up when embedded
in web pages.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed recently-added parsing of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">child-src</span>
content security policy directive, after some web compatibility issues
with it came to light, as well as it becoming clear that the CSP spec
will see it removed in favor of the previous directive for embedded
content. This should fix some intermittent issues people have reported
on e.g. the main google.com page and phpMyAdmin installations.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>26.3.2 (2016-06-27) - Windows only<br>
      </h3>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">This release only has pertinent
changes for Windows. </span>Other operating systems do <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> need this update.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a rare issue where the browser would not initialize
properly (missing bookmarks and menu entries) if certain Windows
registry values were missing (Windows 8 only).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue on Windows 10 where the classic menu bar
would become unreadable (white on white).<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>: There's
apparently a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">different</span>
issue still remaining that can cause the same trouble. Please see the <a
 href="knownissues.shtml">Known Issues</a> page for status and
workaround.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Portable only: Switched to non-compressed binaries to
prevent issues with antivirus packages, to prevent issues with browser
run-time operation, and to simplify code signing.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>26.3.1 (2016-06-25)</h3>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed an issue with new tab button theming on dark toolbars.</li>
        <li>Reverted the useragent identification of Firefox
compatibility mode to 38.9 to avoid WOFF2 font issues for sites that
don't use proper font deployment as recommended by the W3C.</li>
        <li>Added a site-specific override for Google fonts to make
sure it always works even if not using Firefox compatibility mode.<br>
(workaround pending for a proper solution on Google's side)</li>
        <li>Adjusted the "dark color" detection routine to switch text
to white at higher relative contrast levels.<br>
This will more closely match Windows 10's "flip point" for different
accent colors and is within the recommended range determined by the
WCAG.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>26.3.0 (2016-06-21)</h3>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added detection for dark system themes on Windows 10 and
re-worked Windows 10 specific theming to better integrate into the OS
and provide more clarity.</li>
        <li>HTML5 media controls have been reworked to a horizontal
volume control on all media, including HTML5 audio that was previously
without an element-control for volume.</li>
        <li>Default HTML5 media volume preference added as
media.default_volume -- fractional, default 1.0 (=100%).</li>
        <li>String.prototype.match() and .replace() are now fully spec
compliant.</li>
        <li>NSPR and NSS now correctly no longer enforce IA32
architecture compatibility, getting the advantage of SSE2 like the rest
of the code.</li>
        <li>Worked around crashes in the XSS filter when navigating
back in history due to document fragments.</li>
        <li>Instated a hard minimum of 10,000 places entries regardless
of free disk space and total memory to prevent undesired expiration of
history. That is around 16MB for an average entry size, which should be
sane enough even on low-memory machines.</li>
        <li>Fixed a typo in networking code introduced in 26.2.2 that
would cause issues on some sites due to adding extra forward slashes to
the URL.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a number of memory safety hazards and potentially
exploitable crashes.</li>
        <li>Fixed CVE-2016-2821 Use-after-free in the
mozilla::dom::Element class<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed netaddr deserialization for AF_UNSPEC and AF_LOCAL.</li>
        <li>Fixed a memory overrun error in the VP8 encoder. <span
 class="c7">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed non-threadsafe re-use of pixman images to prevent
potential race conditions. <span class="c7">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed CVE-2016-2825 Partial Same Origin Policy violation</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c7"></span>
      <h3>26.2.2 (2016-05-10) &amp; Android 25.9.2<br>
      </h3>
This is mainly a security update.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added a detection routine for dark window colors on Windows
8 and later (system themes using dark window frames) to better adapt to
dark system colors. Theme developers can take advantage of this by
checking for <code>darkwindowframe="true"</code> on <code>#main-window</code>
in CSS selectors.<br>
        </li>
        <li>CSS classes prefixed with "--" no longer stop parsing of
the selectors.</li>
        <li>Several crash fixes.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Made GC suppression more aggressive to prevent issues when
actually out of memory.</li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety hazard in jpeg decoding.</li>
        <li>Fixed a potentially exploitable crash when using
bi-directional text.</li>
        <li>Updated NSS to 3.19.4.2-PM, fixing CVE-2016-1938 among
other things.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>26.2.1 (2016-04-08)</h3>
This is a small update to fix a problem with keyboard navigation of the
user interface.<br>
      <h3>26.2.0 (2016-04-05)</h3>
This is a major update and bugfix release.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Changes:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#api"
 target="_blank">URL API</a> that's needed for a number of websites.</li>
        <li>Changed internal keystroke handling within the spec to
better align with generally expected behavior.<br>
This should fix the infamous "backspace" issue on Facebook.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Web developers please note:</span>
calling preventDefault() in a "keydown" event handler will now prevent
most keypress events from firing.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Linux: gstreamer 1.0 support has been implemented and
enabled by default (hats off to Travis!)<br>
From this version forward you will need to have gstreamer 1.0 libraries
for video playback (0.10 is no longer supported).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Re-styled about:sessionrestore to use more available screen
real estate for tab info.</li>
        <li>Added an option to use the mousewheel for horizontal
scrolling (mouse action value 4).<br>
(e.g. setting <span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">mousewheel.with_shift.action</span>
to <span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">4</span> makes Shift+wheel
scroll horizontally)</li>
        <li>Bumped max icon size for search engine icons to 32 KB to
cater to more common use of HiDPI icons.</li>
        <li>Fixed
some hard-coded branding strings in Sync still reading "Firefox", and
similarly changed sync information URLs to point to our relevant pages.</li>
        <li>Removed default profile bookmarks pointing to
Firefox/Mozilla since the information there no longer applies to us.</li>
        <li>Updated UA overrides and XSS configuration to deal with
some problematic sites (e.g.: Google, Embedly)</li>
        <li>Fixed several issues with the default theme causing
problems with behavior due to styling (thanks, Antonius32) (Issue #384
and friends)</li>
        <li>Fixed some miscellaneous issues in the internal jemalloc
implementation.</li>
        <li>Added a configure option to use the full jemalloc lib
(jemalloc v3) if the builder so wishes (used for Linux, sys mallocs are
not happy there either, so for our generic binaries we switched to this
lib now)</li>
        <li>Worked around a crash caused by the XSS filter on some fora
by bailing on too short and empty strings.</li>
        <li>Fixed layout of reflowed comboboxes without enough space. </li>
        <li>Fixed a crash related to flexboxes overflowing themselves.
(Issue #396)</li>
        <li>Added a simple implementation for Weak Messagelisteners.
(Issue #399)</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash for losing our cache entry while finishing up
compression.<br>
(re-apply after unintentional back-out switching to Goanna)</li>
        <li>Linux: Worked around driver bugs with Intel drivers that
falsely report what they can support in max texture size.</li>
        <li>Portable only: Removed compression of the browser
components library after some reports that in certain configurations
and environments it was causing issues with the browser.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Security fixes:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated the graphite font library to 1.3.7+ to solve
CVE-2016-2796 and no less than 14 of its friends.</li>
        <li>Updated NSS to 3.19.4.2-PM to address several
vulnerabilities (UAF, heap overflow).</li>
        <li>Updated libvorbis to a much more recent version to fix
multiple issues.</li>
        <li>Crash fix and DiD fixes by holding strong references to
objects in suspect places in the HTML parser. (CVE-2016-1961)
(ZDI-CAN-3574)</li>
        <li>Fixed several out-of-bounds issues in the VP8 decoder.</li>
        <li>Fixed a potentially exploitable crash in XML/XSLT handling.</li>
        <li>Applied some Kung Fu to HTML animations and transitions to
prevent memory hazards.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed applicable Mozilla code vulnerabilities
CVE-2016-1965, CVE-2016-1960 (ZDI-CAN-3545), CVE-2016-1966, and
CVE-2016-1963.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>26.1.1 (2016-02-24)</h3>
This is a bugfix release to improve stability and extension
compatibility.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a few oversights in the Firefox extension
compatibility changes in 26.1.0 that should improve compatibility with
a number of Firefox extensions.</li>
        <li>Changed memory handling to (hopefully) address the memory
inflation issues some people have experienced with 26.1.0.</li>
        <li>Updated YouTube compatibility, which should once again
allow users to choose between Flash and HTML5 players on YouTube.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>26.1.0 (2016-02-16)</h3>
This is a web compatibility, stability and bugfix release.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Disabled our ES6 Promise implementation introduced in 26.0
since there were some severe issues with its implementation that caused
a lot of inexplicable failures on websites. This means that some sites
that insist on using Promises without checking availability and that do
not provide sufficient web client compatibility by way of server-side
libraries or polyfills will currently not work as-intended. Apologies
for any inconvenience this may cause; providing a perfectly-working
implementation will be our top priority going forward.</li>
        <li>Improved website compatibility with many sites and web
applications by making our cookie gate less strict.</li>
        <li>Fixed web compatibility with Google Hangouts and Yahoo
Calendar.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Changed the memory allocator on Windows platforms to a much
more modern full-library implementation of jemalloc, with miscellaneous
additional fixes. This should give comparable speed to the system one
and will allocate free memory more dynamically. This should fix issues
like "huge animated gif choking" and inexplicable pauses when using
many tabs, scrolling (extremely) long pages, or viewing media.</li>
        <li>Fixed a few rare crashing issues on Windows due to the
build process.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Reduced so-called "jank" on inner frame scrolling reflows.</li>
        <li>Extension compatibility: partial implementation of Firefox
26 download js modules as shims; this should make more Firefox
extensions compatible with us out-of-the-box. (Thanks, Chaoskagami!)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a "superstop" key combination (<span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153); font-weight: bold;">Shift+Esc</span>)
that will stop all (foreground and background) network activity, stop
animated gifs, etc. even after the page itself has fully loaded (and
the stop button not being available) - some web applications may not
like this if you use it since it will also cancel XHR requests, etc.</li>
        <li>Updated NTLM authentication, deprecating v1 and adding a
proper v2 implementation (Thanks, Trava90!)</li>
        <li>Updated the default theme to tweak/improve it some more
(Thanks, Antonius32!)</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated the Graphite2 font library to 1.3.5+ to fix a
number of vulnerabilities (and some font bugs).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>26.0.3 (2016-02-05)</h3>
This is a small bugfix release:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed our cookie gate to allow cookie names with spaces
in them, to improve web compatibility.<br>
Critical note: if your site uses cookie names with spaces in them,
please consider moving away from doing that so you are no longer in the
"grey" area of cookie behavior.</li>
        <li>Changed the configuration of our XSS filter to address some
known, harmless filter hits that have been reported.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>26.0.2 (2016-02-03)</h3>
This is a bugfix, security and web compatibility release.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed the sanity check for unsupported point-of-sale
XP-based operating systems by user request.<br>
Please see the forum for information on which operating systems we can
reasonably support.</li>
        <li>Changed the way "transparent" is handled in Goanna to
improve transparent gradients using this keyword.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Made sure that <code>dom.disable_beforeunload</code> is
predefined in about:config.</li>
        <li>Fixed web compatibility issues with Youtube, Youtube
Gaming, Yuku fora and Netflix.</li>
        <li>Fixed web compatibility with Comcast/XFinity webmail and
other sites or web applications that expect older JavaScript versions
as default.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Reinstated the about:config warning by default.</li>
        <li>Fixed 2 potential browser crashes.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated NSS to 3.19.4.1-PM to fix a potential UAF and
CVE-2015-7575.</li>
        <li>Crash fix: Prevented queueing multiple media sources that
could lead to unsafe memory access.</li>
        <li>Prevented unsafe memory manipulations in zip archives.
(CVE-2016-1945) <span class="c7">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Prevented a potential buffer overflow in WebGL. (x64 only)
(CVE-2016-1935) <span class="c7">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Updated the way binaries are code-signed. Not only does
v26.0 use a new
SHA256-signed digital certificate, but starting this version will also
be signed with both SHA1 and SHA256 digest algorithms to satisfy later
Windows' code-signing requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c7">DiD</span> This means that the fix is
"Defense-in-Depth": It is a fix that does not apply to an actively
exploitable vulnerability in Pale Moon, but prevents future
vulnerabilities caused by the same code when surrounding code changes,
exposing the problem.<br>
      <h3>26.0.1 (unreleased)</h3>
Internal development/test version.<br>
      <h3>26.0.0 (2016-01-26)</h3>
This
is a new milestone release! It's been in the works for a good number of
months, and has many hundreds of notable changes, fixes, and
improvements that can't possibly all be listed here.<br>
      <br>
These release notes for this version are a concise summary, lifting out
the most prominent and important changes. You may find slightly more
detailed
release notes on the forum.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">General release notes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><img
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 200px; height: 66px;"
 alt="Goanna logo" src="images/goanna200x66.png" align="left" hspace="4"
 vspace="4">Pale Moon is now building on
the new Goanna engine instead of Gecko. Although close relatives in
terms of web technology, they are not the same under the hood and any
reports of bugs with the layout/rendering
engine should be as detailed as possible to allow us to pinpoint the
cause of the bugs and fix them
(just stating "it works in Firefox" <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span>
doesn't help us!). If you wish to report issues, please either use the <a
 href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/Pale-Moon/issues"
 target="_blank">issue tracker</a> on GitHub or report a detailed
description and steps to reproduce on the <a
 href="http://forum.palemoon.org/" target="_blank">forum</a>.</span> <br>
        </li>
        <li>We've had to reduce the number of supported languages for
our language packs. With the need to move to our own full localization
and lacking translators to support and maintain less common languages
in use around the world, we've reduced our number of offered languages
to a little over 30. The languages still supported should more than
cover
the common languages spoken around the globe. You will need to update
your language packs!</li>
        <li>Although we've given this release extensive testing, it is
still possible you run into some website compatibility issues (usually
because of websites doing useragent sniffing) and e.g. some sites
displaying a mobile version if they do not recognize or incorrectly
recognize the new browser engine. Please always try <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">contacting the webmasters first</span>
before posting support requests at our address, since this is usually
not something we can provide solutions for, ourselves, and we end up
having to redirect you anyway.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>The layout parser/renderer has received many updates with
this change over to Goanna, improving web compatibility and standards
compliance in many areas.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The browser user interface has received updates, making it
more compatible with Windows 10 in many respects and more in line with
the general styles of the operating system version it is run on in
terms of the shapes of controls and color setting.</li>
        <li>Updated graphics/media support: Pale Moon now supports the
WebP image format, properly scales EXIF rotated JPEGs, has updated
support for different WebGL texture formats, improved scaling of vector
images, updated libpng, libjpeg-turbo, libvpx, and misc other upstream
libraries/modules, and more! </li>
        <li>Library changes: <br>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>The library now has a scope bar (pops up when searching)
with the option to select what you want to search in (either bookmarks
or history) and the option to save your searches.</li>
          <li>By default, there will be a history menu drop-down in the
browser's user interface next to the bookmarks one.</li>
          <li>Added "Containing folder" and "Containing folder path"
columns so you can see exactly where a bookmark is located at a glance
when searching (after enabling the columns).<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Added support for Ruby annotations. If you need this
functionality, set the about:config preference <code>browser.ruby.enabled</code>
to <code>true</code>, and restart the browser.</li>
        <li>Added conservative image decoding: it will now only decode
images that are (almost) in view, greatly improving overall memory use
and initial loading of graphics-heavy pages.</li>
        <li>Aligned 3D CSS transforms and perspective with the spec.</li>
        <li>JavaScript improvements: added basic support for ES6
Promises, added element.matches(), updated property assignments, added
Bin/Oct literals in Number(), improved performance of TypeOf calls,
improved GC memory shrinking, improved memory allocations, improved
RegEx performance and compatibility, and more!</li>
        <li>Added CSS media queries to determine the OS the browser is
running on, allowing theme designers to make specific changes based on
OS at run-time.</li>
        <li>Added a control preference for onunload= events as <code>dom.disable_beforeunload</code>.
This allows you to completely disable events fired when leaving a page.</li>
        <li>Changed the memory allocator to the (faster) system
allocator on modern operating systems.</li>
        <li>Improved the handling of very large numbers of tabs.</li>
        <li>Added Ecosia as a "green" search engine alternative for the
environmentally aware surfer.</li>
        <li>Autoplay
of media now has a separate control preference for scripted content as <code>media.autoplay.allowscripted</code>,
to block script-initiated autoplay of media.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security updates:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added
support for 128-bit Camellia-GCM ciphers in addition to the existing
CBC ciphers to offer a more internationally diverse choice of secure
encryption ciphers than just AES.</li>
        <li>Added an advanced,
active XSS (cross-site scripting) filter. Pale Moon will now check for
XSS attacks and block XSS content in the resulting
pages. This is brand-new technology and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">feedback on this filter specifically</span>
(e.g. bugs, false positives, etc.) <span style="font-weight: bold;">should
be posted in the <a
 href="https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=10817"
 target="_blank">dedicated thread on the forum</a> for this feature.</span>
Please also see that thread for details on how to use and control this
filter.</li>
        <li>Distrusted several root certificates in accordance with
security best practice.</li>
        <li>Aligned
cookie acceptance with RFC 6265 §4.1.1. We still
make an exception for allowing spaces and double quotes in cookie
values, but this will be made more strict in the future for full spec
compliance. If you are a web designer and use cookies, please verify
that you are RFC compliant in terms of both cookie names and cookie
values, or the browser may reject them.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed several hazardous modules like the maintenance
service and the identity module.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Ported
all security updates from Mozilla that are applicable/relevant to our
code base (up to and including all security issues made known to us
until now). Considering v26 has been kept updated over its long
development until release, the list of fixes/CVEs would be too
exhaustive to list in these release notes individually.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h1> Release notes for version 25 releases </h1>

        <li>Fix for a crash that could occur at random since the update
to 25.8.0.</li>
        <li>Fix for CSP (Content Security Policy) to be more lenient
towards the incorrect passing of full URLs with all sorts of parameters
in the CSP header, leading to misinterpretation of the header and
incorrectly blocking the loading of content.<br>

        <li>Added size checks in canvas manipulations to avoid
potential image encoding vulnerabilities like CVE-2015-7189. <span
 class="c7">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed potential information disclosure vulnerabilities
through the NTLM authentication mechanism. Insecure NTLM v1 is now
disabled by default, and the workstation name is set to WORKSTATION by
default (configurable with a preference for environments where
identification of workstations is done by actual reported machine
name). This avoids issues like CVE-2015-4515.</li>
        <li>Fixed a potentially vulnerable crash from a spinning event
loop during resize painting. <span class="c7">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed several Javascript-based memory safety hazards. <span
 class="c7">DiD</span></li>

      <h3>25.7.3.1 (Android only!) (2015-10-15)</h3>
A small update to the Android version only to fix an issue with the
Sync setup still not working properly on Android clients.<br>
      <h3>25.7.3 (2015-10-14)</h3>
This
is a usability update needed due to the fact that Mozilla has shut down
their key exchange (J-PAKE) server along with the old Sync servers.
This
was unexpected and required us to set up our own key server (testing
indicates this works as-expected, but please do report any issues on
the forum) - which also required reconfiguration of the browser.<br>
Please note that older versions of the browser will no longer be able
to link devices to a sync account using the 12-character code since it
requires a Mozilla server no longer present. If you need this
functionality, you must update to this version or later.<br>
      <h3>25.7.2 (2015-10-02)</h3>
This is a stability update, addressing 2 critical hangs:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a critical hang caused by recursive reloads that
might happen in iframes if its hash changed.</li>
        <li>Fixed a critical hang caused by lazy-loading of stylesheets
through a specific web programming technique as advocated by Google's
PageSpeed.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>25.7.1 (2015-09-28)</h3>
This
is a security, stability and web-compatibility update. This also marks
a security update for the Android version of Pale Moon to keep users of
the otherwise currently unmaintained OS updated regarding known
security vulnerabilities.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Code cleanup: Removed the majority of remaining telemetry
code (including the data reporting back-end and health report) to
prevent a few issues with partially removed code in earlier versions.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash due to handling of bogus URIs passed to CSS
style filters (e.g. whatsapp's web interface).</li>
        <li>Permitted spec-breaking syntax in Regex character classes,
allowing ranges that would be permitted per the grammar rules in the
spec but not necessarily following the syntax rules. This impacts a
good number of (also higher profile) sites that use invalid ranges in
regular expressions (e.g. Cisco's networking academy site, Yahoo
Fantasy Football).</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash due to the newly introduced WASAPI handling
of audio channel mapping that doesn't like actual surround hardware
setups (e.g. playing a video with quadraphonic audio on a 4-speaker
setup).</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where site-specific dictionary selections
would be written to content preferences without the user's action,
potentially overwriting or clearing a previously-chosen dictionary.</li>
        <li>Added support for drag and drop of local files from sources
which use text/uri-lists. (Some Linux flavors/file managers)</li>
        <li>Updated libnestegg to the most current version.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where setting the location to an empty
string could cause a reload loop.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the jemalloc poison address to something that is
not a NOP-slide. <span class="c7">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety hazard in ConvertDialogOptions
(CVE-2015-4521)</li>
        <li>Fixed a buffer overflow/crash hazard in the
VertexBufferInterface::reserveVertexSpace function in libGLES in ANGLE
(CVE-2015-7179)</li>
        <li>Fixed an overflow/crash hazard in the
XULContentSinkImpl::AddText function (CVE-2015-7175)</li>
        <li>Fixed a stack buffer overread hazard in the ICC v4 profile
parser (CVE-2015-4504)</li>
        <li>Fixed an HTMLVideoElement Use-After-Free Remote Code
Execution 0-day vulnerability (ZDI-CAN-3176) (CVE-2015-4509)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potentially exploitable crash in
nsXBLService::GetBinding</li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety hazard in nsAttrAndChildArray::GrowBy
(CVE-2015-7174)</li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety hazard for callers of
nsUnicodeToUTF8::GetMaxLength (CVE-2015-4522)</li>
        <li>Fixed a heap buffer overflow/crash hazard caused by invalid
WebM headers (CVE-2015-4511)</li>

      <h3>25.7.0 (2015-08-26)</h3>
This is a bugfix and maintenance release.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Code cleanup: Removed the (otherwise unused) visual event
tracer code.</li>
        <li>Code cleanup: Removed reflow performance tracing code
(telemetry).</li>
        <li>Fixed a key JavaScript bug where defining properties on an
object would wipe the object.<br>
This seems to be a common issue with "modern" libraries that use
"define" instead of "change" and expecting the other properties on the
object to be retained, resulting in "x is undefined" errors all over
the place if the object is wiped.<br>
This aligns the behavior with ES6's "Validate and apply property
descriptor" pseudo-function.</li>
        <li>Updated the SQLite library to 3.8.11.1.</li>
        <li>Added support for the <a
 href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/matches"
 target="_blank">element.matches()</a> Web API function.</li>
        <li>Added support for BASE tag parsing in source view.
Previously, when viewing the source of a document, clickable links
would be incorrect if a base path was specified in the document with
this tag.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with running timers after the computer would
have been put to sleep with the browser opened.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added protection against potential bugs where our SVG
mPositions is out of sync with the characters in the DOM. <span
 class="c7">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed use-after-free vulnerability in
XMLHttpRequest::Open() (CVE-2015-4492)</li>
        <li>Fixed use-after-free vulnerability in the
StyleAnimationValue class (CVE-2015-4488)</li>
        <li>Fixed crash or memory corruption in nsTArray (CVE-2015-4489)</li>
        <li>Fixed crash or memory corruption in
nsTSubstring::ReplacePrep (CVE-2015-4487)</li>
        <li>Fixed potential escalation of privileges or crash
(out-of-bounds write) via a crafted name in MARs (x64 only)
(CVE-2015-4482)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that would allow man-in-the-middle attackers
to
bypass a mixed-content protection mechanism via a feed: URL in a POST
request.
(CVE-2015-4483)</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c7"></span>
      <h3>25.6.0 (2015-07-27)</h3>
This release addresses some security issues and a range of usability
improvements to the browser.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Canvas anti-fingerprinting option: Pale Moon now includes
the option to make canvas fingerprinting much more difficult. By
setting the about:config preference <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">canvas.poisondata</span>
to true, any data read back from canvas surfaces will be "poisoned"
with humanly-imperceptible data changes. By default this is off,
because it has a large performance impact on the routines reading this
data.</li>
        <li>Added a feature to allow icon fonts to be used even when
users disallow the use of document-specified fonts. This should retain
full navigation for icon-font heavy websites (no more dreaded "boxes"
with hex codes) when custom text fonts are disabled.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a feature to prevent screen savers from kicking in
when playing full-screen HTML5 video. This is currently not yet
operational on Linux because of stability issues we've run into on that
OS, but Windows should properly benefit from this change.</li>
        <li>The "autocomplete=off" parameter for signon forms is now
completely ignored by default, to keep the user in control of their
browser's behavior and allowing credentials to be saved if wished. If
you prefer the previous behavior, allowing a website to determine
whether autocomplete should be allowed or not, then change the
about:config preference <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">signon.ignoreAutocomplete</span>
to false.</li>
        <li>Reinstated the packaging of pre-compiled scripts in the
browser. Hopefully this will fix the reports by some users who found
that initial start-up after installation/upgrade of the browser was
unacceptably slow. Unfortunately this means a slightly larger
download/install size as a trade-off.</li>
        <li>Added the option to use Chrome://../skin/ overrides, in
effect allowing the use of "Icon themes"; toolbar icon replacements to
customize your browser icons without the need for any CSS or full-blown
theming.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a count for the number of matches in the find bar. it
will now list the total number of matches found, and which match is the
currently highlighted one.</li>
        <li>Fixed the issue where highlighted words after finding and
highlighting them all in a page would remain highlighted when closing
the find bar.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added support for CSP 'nonce' keywords (CSP 1.1/2.0).
Please note that this is still experimental and may not work 100%
as-expected. Please report any bugs you may find.</li>
        <li>Aligned CSP more with the spec in terms of reporting and
case-sensitivity of matches, and made it more app-friendly.</li>
        <li>Added -moz-os-version selectors for @media CSS queries to
simplify theming on different operating systems (esp. Windows).</li>
        <li>Updated and improved several languages for the Status Bar
code, and added Slovenian.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue in the internal updater window not showing
proper language strings.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the unexpected use of
"backface-visibility" on non-3D transformed elements (like the body)
would break positioned elements on web pages.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed text positioning in the combobox display area when a
non-default height is set for the combobox.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a crash caused by bad Opus audio encoding in media
files.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash when trying to measure memory in about:memory
while playing video.</li>
        <li>Fixed a rare crash in sLayersAccelerationPrefsInitialized<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed miscellaneous other crashes.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a DNS prefetching issue for the people using this
feature.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with single-word searches from the address
bar when a proxy is in use.</li>
        <li>Fixed a number of build issues on Linux when using system
libs.</li>
        <li>Added support for link-time optimization on newer Linux
compilers.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed more telemetry code (ongoing project!).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety bug due to a bad test in
nsZipArchive.cpp (CVE-2015-2735).</li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety bug in nsZipArchive::BuildFileList
(CVE-2015-2736).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety bug caused by an overflow in
nsXMLHttpRequest::AppendToResponseText (CVE-2015-2740).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a Use After Free in CanonicalizeXPCOMParticipant
(CVE-2015-2722).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed off-main-thread nsIPrincipal use of various consumers
in the tree (only grab the principal when needed).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where an IPDL message was sent off the main
thread.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a potentially exploitable TCPSocket crash due to a
race condition.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 25.5.0 (2015-06-10) </h3>

reduce tracking (Squarefractal)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Allow plugin-specific (.dll based) OOPP overrides also for
npswf. This will not be used for the "master switch" for OOPP and Flash
will still be in the plugin container, unless a specific
dom.ipc.plugins.enabled.npswf*.dll boolean is set to override.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a crash during WebGL Conformance Tests for undefined
indices (Toady)<br>

        </li>
        <li>Updated libpng to version 1.5.22<br>

logically<br>
(0=off, 1=secure only, 2=secure+mixed, 3=all)<br>
- Cleaned up CSS<br>
- Cleaned up padlock logic a little<br>
        </li>
        <li>Hard-coded internal UA sniffing values for the extension

This is a small but important update to the previous major release to
address some critical issues:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed loss of the browser's disk cache on startup due to
incorrect corruption detection logic<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">IMPORTANT:
If you use a language pack, make sure to update it to the latest
version!</span> We do have automatic updates enabled for language packs
but please double-check that the version matches. If you are using an
older language pack with this version of the browser, some dialog boxes
may come up blank.<br>
      <br>
This is a major update - too much has changed for this little blurb to
do it justice so please see below for the most important changes/fixes
in this release:<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>

        </li>
        <li>Added a new "mixed-mode" state for HTTPS connections.
Clarified mixed-mode connections with a mixed-mode padlock and better
tooltips. </li>
        <li>Added a conditional partial shading to the URL bar and made
it default (shading only on secure sites, no red shading at all by
default).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Dev: Fixed file system mode flags for *nix systems, to make
executable files like scripts actually flagged as executable </li>
        <li>Added native IPv6 lookups to NSPR to solve IPv6-only and
dual-stack setups in some situations<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a pref to control the unloading of idle plugins from
memory and lowered the default "idle" time to 60 seconds before plugins
are unloaded<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed version strings for e.g. flash on Linux being
displayed with commas instead of periods - this should also fix the
incorrect "your plugin is vulnerable" message while being on the latest
version </li>
        <li>Windows: Set the double-click/Ctrl+arrow word selection to <span
 class="c5">not</span> eat the space (only select the actual word) </li>
        <li>Android: DNS fix for VPN connections, preventing the
"server not found" issues people have been reporting for certain VPN
providers on mobile<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated a number of trusted root certificates, and
distrusted the CNNIC root certificate by popular demand<br>
        </li>
        <li>Linux: Worked around the slice memory allocator not being
properly disabled on later GLib versions </li>
        <li>Android: updated the random number generator handling on
later versions of Android </li>
        <li>Added fix to prevent spurious re-paints with plugins
(performance/UX improvement) </li>
        <li>Removed the plugin check link from the Addons Manager,
since it's no longer reliable and not officially available for browsers
except Mozilla Firefox. (Bonus: no user profiling/tracking through
optimizely!) </li>
        <li>Optimized the NSS callback for secure connections </li>
        <li>Updated the domains that are whitelisted for installation
of extensions/themes/personas, streamlining the use of
addons.palemoon.org<br>
        </li>

lightweight theme's coloring/shading) in custom titlebar mode (Pale
Moon appmenu/button) </li>
        <li>Added display of HTTPS protocol (SSL/TLS) to the page info
window (thanks Travis!) </li>
        <li>Improved certificate display: Removed MD5 and added SHA256
fingerprint, and made them selectable/copyable </li>
        <li>Updated classification of secure connections: Classify any
encryption with less than 128 bits or including RC4 (if manually

use in extensions to the nsISSLStatus interface
(nsISSLStatus.cipherSuite) </li>
        <li>Added MAKE_UNLINKABLE to the about: page redirector and
added that as default for the reader mode on Android </li>
        <li>Removed the compilation and inclusion of a one-time-use
pre-compiled startup cache in omni.ja, reducing overall application
size significantly and avoiding a number of quirks of both the build
process and the operation of the browser </li>
        <li>Fixed an NVIDIA specific GLX server vendor bug for pixmap
depth and fbConfig depth </li>
        <li>Removed most telemetry code, reducing code complexity and
wasted CPU<br>
        </li>
        <li>Linux: Added OSS support (mutually exclusive with ALSA):
configure with --enable-oss </li>
        <li>Made DNS caching a lot less aggressive to align the

      <h3> 25.3.2 (2015-04-25) </h3>
This release is an emergency update to fix crashes that started
occurring because of Mozilla improperly signing the extensions and
extension updates as offered through the Firefox Add-ons site
addons.mozilla.org. Any improperly signed extension would not be able
to be installed, and would immediately crash the browser.<span
 class="c2"><br>
      <br>
No other changes were made in this release - this is a bugfix for this
particular issue only.<br>
      </span>
      <h3> 25.3.1 (2015-03-25) </h3>
This is a security update to the browser to address a critical
vulnerability found in the pwn2own contest. Only one vulnerability
found in this contest applies to Pale Moon, which has been addressed in
this update.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>

This vulnerability would allow remote attackers to bypass the Same
Origin Policy and execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome
privileges via vectors involving SVG hash navigation. </li>
        <li>Fixed IPv6 DNS resolution regression in some less common
cases. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 25.3.0 (2015-03-13) </h3>
This is an important update to improve features and performance, as

        </li>
        <li>Updated the ANGLE library to a much more current version.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed the crash reporter code completely to improve
overall browser responsiveness and operation.<br>
Please note that a necessary victim of this has been the in-browser
(devtools) SPS profiler because of its reliance on crash reporter
data-gathering tools.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed the Mozilla Plugin Finder Service (no longer in use
@Mozilla). </li>
        <li>Android: removed the Mozilla "product announcements"
service.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Re-added control of the number of concurrent tabs to be

overall legibility of tab text, and display of inverted close buttons
on some controls on dark personas.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a special case check for the Flash plugin version
check on Linux failing due to commas instead of periods in the version
string. </li>

This means that the fix is "Defense-in-Depth": It is a fix that does
not apply to an actively exploitable vulnerability in Pale Moon, but
prevents future vulnerabilities caused by the same code when
surrounding code changes, exposing the problem.

      <h3> 25.1.1 (2014-11-28) Android only! </h3>
This point release for Android only addresses critical browser issues
(crash on startup) when trying to run Pale Moon on Android 5.0 (AKA
Android-L or Lollipop). No other changes involved in this release.<br>
      <h3> 25.1.0 (2014-11-14) </h3>
This is an important update after rapid development on the back-end to
keep pace with the current changes on the web and improve compatibility
with websites.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>New feature: multi-line flexbox support.<br>
Pale Moon now supports more advanced multi-line and multi-column flex
elements. This will allow websites to use these elements for easier
responsive design of web pages and ordering/layout of multiple
elements. This has been on Pale Moon's to-do list for a while but was
rather complex to tackle, hence the delay in implementation. This
should address layout issues on several recently-updated websites (e.g.
the MSN home page). </li>
        <li>New feature: added support for collapsed flex element items.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Enhanced feature: Content Security Policy (CSP)<br>
Pale Moon now fully supports the CSP 1.0 specification allowing
websites to set restrictions on content to prevent XSS (Cross-site
scripting) attacks. Previously, the implementation in Pale Moon was
partial, and did not support a number of features, resulting in some
websites not rendering properly because Pale Moon was being too strict
in enforcing the policy. This should address issues on websites
enforcing CSP (e.g. the Dropbox web interface and FaceBook galleries). </li>
        <li>New feature: added support for iframes with inline content.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the Firefox Compatibility mode version to 31.9.<br>
With the improvements in rendering and overall feature set, the Firefox
Compatibility mode (as presented in the UserAgent string) has been
bumped to prevent websites from complaining about "using a too
old/unsupported version of Firefox" (e.g. Google websites). </li>
        <li>Pale Moon no longer builds the so-called "media navigator"
by default.<br>
This module provides access to the user's webcam and microphone.
Although it can be used for other purposes, in practice this is only
used for WebRTC and, in fact, its support (GetUserMedia) is often
mistaken for actually supporting WebRTC in a browser (causing errors
since Pale Moon does not support WebRTC). No longer including these
features reduces input complexity and overhead for a feature not
actively used. This also circumvents privacy concerns/confusion like
CVE-2014-1586.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Improved tab handling on lightweight themes (personas) some
more to enhance contrast on certain themes and to make the tab hover
effect slightly more distinct. </li>
        <li>Fixed oversized/blocky menu arrows on Windows 8.1 in HiDPI
mode. </li>
        <li>Fixed incorrect operating system being passed on to
addons.mozilla.org. </li>
        <li>Fixed an error being thrown in the error console/web
console when opening a new window. </li>
        <li>Removed the NVidia 3D Vision auxiliary utility library.<br>
This library has been the likely cause for a number of crashes on
NVidia cards, and is completely unnecessary for Pale Moon.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Made the installer less aggressive for file type
associations, to prevent "stealing" of globally associated file types.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Android: improved restoring of session tabs. </li>
        <li>Android: added an option to automatically restore tabs.<br>
An important thing to note with this new option is the following: with
the option enabled, Pale Moon will now automatically restore tabs you
had open previously when the app gets suspended (pushed out of memory
by other apps, closed by swipe, etc.). The "quit" main menu option,
however, completely shuts down your session, unloads Pale Moon from
active memory, and tabs will not be automatically restored when you
launch Pale Moon again. This is by design. To restore tabs in that
situation, use the link from the home screen.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed memory security hazards CVE-2014-1574 and
CVE-2014-1575 <span class="c6">security fix</span> </li>
        <li>Fixed CVE-2014-1581. <span class="c6">security fix</span> </li>
        <li>Fixed bug 1069584: Bail if a cairo surface is in an invalid
state. <span class="c6">security fix</span> </li>
        <li>Made sure to initialize surfaces for draw targets. <span
 class="c6">security fix</span> </li>
        <li>Fixed CVE-2014-1594: Use AsContainerLayer() in order to
avoid a bad cast. <span class="c6">security fix</span> </li>
        <li>Fixed several problems in the HTML parser. <span class="c6">security
fix</span> </li>
        <li>Improved security of XHR by filtering out types of requests
that can potentially be abused. <span class="c6">security fix</span> </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 25.0.2 (2014-10-24) </h3>
This is a small update to address a number of teething problems with
the new milestone release.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added a "Firefox compatibility mode" selection in Options
-&gt; Advanced.<br>
This mode is enabled by default (reluctantly so), because too many
websites (including some very big players who, themselves, promote an
Open Web...) still use very poor browser detection methods based on
arbitrary User Agent string comparisons, not catering to alternative
browsers, and the resulting user experience being poor (being presented
with mobile site layouts, broken pages, or even being flat-out refused
service because someone exercises freedom of choice for web browser
used). This should alleviate most, if not all, issues with
browser-discriminating websites. </li>
        <li>Improved active tab display on particularly dark personas.<br>
People using "black" personas/lightweight themes should now have a lot
less difficulty distinguishing the active tab.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Disabled SSL 3.0 by default (to put a muzzle on the <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE">POODLE</a>).<br>
Please note that this may cause issues with some poorly configured web
servers (usually ones with a hopelessly broken security setup that do
not support TLS 1.2 or secure (re)negotiation of the protocol).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed add-on update issue (that was preventing update
checking through addons.palemoon.org).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the redundant redundancy in asking redundantly if the
browser would be allowed to ask to install an extension when not on
addons.mozilla.org.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the internal UA-sniffing insanity that broke devtools
in a few different and colorful ways.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 25.0.1 (2014-10-15) </h3>
This is a small update to address an important Jetpack extension
compatibility issue and includes a number of security fixes.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Update of the add-on SDK to add missing "Pale Moon" engine
entries to lists. This should fix extension compatibility issues for
jetpack extensions that otherwise already work with the new GUID. </li>
        <li>About box release notes link corrected </li>
        <li>Fix for VP9 decoder vulnerability <span class="c6">security
fix</span> </li>
        <li>Fix for direct access to raw connection sockets in http <span
 class="c6">security fix</span> </li>
        <li>Fix for unsafe conversion to JSON of data through the alarm
dom element <span class="c6">security fix</span> </li>
        <li>Update of NSS to 3.16.2.2-RTM <span class="c6">security fix</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 25.0.0 (2014-10-10) </h3>

      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Change of the browser's GUID (Globally Unique Identifier)
to properly differentiate from Firefox.<br>

        <li>Allow extensions with both Pale Moon GUID and Firefox GUID
to be installed natively (dual-ID system).<br>
Pale Moon GUID blocks will have preference over Firefox (compatibility)
blocks. </li>
        <li>Disconnect of Pale Moon's "Firefox compatibility" version
from Pale Moon's application version to maintain Firefox 24.* extension
compatibility regardless of Pale Moon version. </li>
        <li>Disable Firefox Compatibility mode by default.<br>
This means Pale Moon will no longer have a Firefox/xx.xx indicator in
its UserAgent string.<br>
This may impact some websites that check browsers by UserAgent and
possibly warn, complain or block you. You should contact the site's
owners and request support for Pale Moon. Pale Moon will allow you to
override the UserAgent on a per-site basis if you absolutely <span
 class="c7">must</span> visit the site and they absolutely <span
 class="c7">won't</span> cater to your freedom of browser choice. </li>
        <li>Use the alternative sync implementation on a new server.<br>
Current Pale Moon sync accounts cannot be ported over, so you will have
to create a new account when updating to v25.<br>
The previous server implementation has already been shut down due to
continued issues, and will be retired on the very short term to free up
infrastructure and reduce expenses. The alternative sync implementation
is Sync 1.1 compatible, like before.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Stop building the WebApp runtime by default.<br>
The use of "Web Applications" started from the command-line is such a
niche feature that it has no business being in Pale Moon's main-line
builds.<br>
If you need the WebApp runtime for your specific organization and want
to use Pale Moon, you can build Pale Moon from source with the feature
enabled. </li>
        <li> <span class="c2">Stop supporting Windows XP.</span> As
mentioned a few times before, Pale Moon's support for Windows XP (and
any other NT 5.x based operating system) has now ended. An exception to
this is the specialized Atom build because of limited operating system
availability on netbooks and the like. More details on the <a
 href="PM_end_of_WinXP_support.shtml">dedicated page for this change</a>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>By default, do not sync add-ons.<br>
Syncing between different devices will likely not want you to sync the
add-ons in use. There's a reason you're using different devices, after
all. </li>
        <li>Un-prefix CSS box-sizing.<br>
You can now use <span class="c4">box-sizing:border-box</span>, <span
 class="c4">box-sizing:padding-box</span> and <span class="c4">box-sizing:content-box</span>
to switch box-sizing mode on elements using CSS. </li>
        <li>Implement image-orientation in CSS.<br>
You can now use <span class="c4">image-orientation: {angle} [flip]</span>
in CSS to rotate images in 90 degree steps and optionally flip them. </li>
        <li>Improve bookmark menu item-dragging.<br>
Dragging bookmarks in the bookmarks menu is now more convenient (allow
diagonal dragging, prevent tooltips from interfering, etc.).<br>
(Fixes bugs 225434, 419911 and 555474) </li>
        <li>Move the option to "use the classic downloads window" from
status bar preferences to the main options window.<br>
This way, it's easier for people to find and it's in a much more
logical place. The classic downloads window will not go away any time
soon in Pale Moon. </li>
        <li>Update branding images for official/unofficial logo, and
some about: pages. </li>
        <li>Add a new type of "blank new tab" page with logo-styling.<br>
This logo page will be the default setting (instead of about:blank). </li>
        <li>Add Opus audio to WebM. </li>
        <li> <span class="c2">Add VP9</span> codec to WebM on both
desktop and Android/ARM. </li>
        <li>Allow absolute-in-relative positioning in table and CSS
table-cell elements. </li>
        <li>Allow the user to override the use of accessibility colors
in the browser with <span class="c8">browser.display.ignore_accessibility_theme</span>
        </li>
        <li>Improve the display of tabs when lightweight themes
(personas) are in use for both light and dark themes. </li>
        <li>Enable cache compression by default to more efficiently use
disk cache. </li>
        <li>When shutting down the browser while you still have
downloads in progress, Pale Moon will now by default warn you that the
downloads will be cancelled.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added language packs for Acholi, Assamese, Kashubian,
Pulaar Fulfulde, Armenian, Khmer, Ligure, Mongolian, and Swahili.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c2">Bug/regression fixes:</span><br>

      <h3> 24.7.1 (2014-08-06) </h3>
This is a bugfix release for some outstanding issues in 24.7.0.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a text rendering issue with the new back-end on
overdraw layers when hardware acceleration is in use on Windows. This
may also solve some additional small issues in the user interface that
weren't present before 24.7.0.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the use of Google Maps.<br>
If you previously used the workaround in 24.7, then please remove the
user-set preference (right-click -&gt; reset).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 24.7.0 (2014-07-29) </h3>
This is a large update to address a good number of different things
across the board. If you want more details about these changes, check
the more detailed announcement on the forum.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed some performance issues with the new rendering engine
on Windows. Rendering should be faster for all objects on
hardware-accelerated layers now.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Font rendering on Direct2D will no longer fall back to
greyscale in some situations, preserving ClearType. </li>
        <li>CSS outlines will now properly outline the object, and not
the overflow area (e.g. box shadow). </li>
        <li>The delay for hiding the default status has been increased
from 10 to 30 seconds to keep it on screen sufficiently long but not
permanently. </li>
        <li>Queries for "can play type" on WebM videos now get an
HTML5-compliant response ("maybe" instead of "yes" as per the
specification when a codec is not included in the request). </li>
        <li>Pale Moon's gecko rendering engine and Firefox
compatibility version now properly follows the minor version of Pale
Moon again instead of always returning .0 - this should help UA
sniffing websites to more easily detect Pale Moon or adapt to
further-developed gecko 24 versions. </li>
        <li>When using dark/black personas (lightweight themes), the
tab close buttons would be almost invisible. They have been lightened a
little to make them clearer. </li>
        <li>Linux: the click behavior on the address bar has been
unified with that on Windows, aiming for current-day desktop-clipboard
use (select-when-clicked). This is configurable with a preference. </li>
        <li>"In-content" preferences (preferences displayed in a tab
instead of the normal dialog box) has been removed because of
redundancy and incompleteness. </li>
        <li>Checking for updates from the about box now always puts the
user in control and never downloads anything directly from the about
box. It will pop up the larger update window when an update is found. </li>
        <li>Google SafeBrowsing, which is defunct, has been removed
from the browser. <span class="c9">privacy fix</span> </li>
        <li>Made the building of the Web Developer tools optional when
compiling Pale Moon through --disable-devtools. </li>
        <li>The Atom-optimized version no longer ships with the Web
Developer tools to slim down the browser for limited platforms where
these tools are considered generally unneeded. </li>
        <li>Fixed domain highlighting in the address bar. It should no
longer randomly lose this formatting when switching tabs or otherwise
updating the browser UI. </li>
        <li>Fixed missing click-to-play overlay on some zoom levels for
plugins embedded in an iframe. </li>
        <li>Fixed large delays in print enumeration on Windows,
especially when printing to file: ports.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the list of known domain suffixes. </li>
        <li>Updated site-specific user-agent strings to prevent
incorrect complaints from websites (google.com, aol.com, etc.) that use
poor detection scripts.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added granular referer control. See the release
announcement on the forum for more details on how to use this.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added gr locale to the status bar options. </li>
        <li>Disabled HQ image downscaling. This is a workaround for the
broken Mozilla HQ downscaling back-end causing constant invalidations
and redrawing if 2 downscaled images with the same source were in view.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the NSS library to 3.16.2 RTM to address a few
critical SSL issues. <span class="c9">security fix</span><br>
        </li>
        <li>There was a possibility to lose the source frame for raster
images if images had to be discarded in low-memory situations. This has
been fixed. <span class="c9">security fix</span><br>
        </li>
        <li>Made refcounting logic around PostTimerEvent more explicit.
          <span class="c9">security fix</span> </li>
        <li>Prevented an invalid pointer state in docloader. <span
 class="c9">security fix</span> </li>
        <li>Added proper refcounting of font faces. <span class="c9">security
fix</span> </li>
        <li>Android: lots of branding updates to make it more
release-ready. </li>
        <li>Android: explicitly set the Pale Moon Sync server in
preferences. </li>
        <li>Android: IonMonkey (ARM): guarded against branches being
out of range and bail out if so. <span class="c9">security fix</span> </li>
        <li>Android: enabled Firefox compatibility mode on Android to
allow the installation of extensions from AMO. </li>
        <li>Android: added a "Quit" option to the app menu to properly
immediately close the browser. </li>
        <li>Android: IonMonkey (ARM): prevented a performance issue due
to clobbering the primary scratch register. </li>
        <li>Android: enabled mobile-specific optimizations to increase
performance on mobile devices. </li>
        <li>Android: enabled AES-128 and AES-256 in addition to RC4 for
Sync.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 24.6.2 (2014-06-16) </h3>
A point release to address some further outstanding issues with the
overhauled rendering engine.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Automate rendering back-end selection and use cairo as
appropriate.<br>
This should fix start-up problems on all types of graphics cards
regardless of vendor.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fix font subpixel rendering in menus when on cairo backend
(D2D off)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Cairo: Prevent falling back to padding when not strictly
needed.<br>
Performance regression fix if D2D isn't used. </li>
        <li>Azure: Use correct device offsets.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Prevent crashes due to the allocation of source surfaces to
errored surfaces<br>
This prevents some miscellaneous browser crashes occurring with cairo
on azure.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 24.6.1 (2014-06-08) </h3>
A quick point release update mainly to address startup crashes.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Update to address startup crashes if users previously
changed the setting for Azure for Content </li>
        <li>Update for texture handling to restore GDI compatibility
(should fix some graphics glitches) </li>
        <li>Fix to handle invalid PDF plugin overlay state </li>
        <li>Misc. additional security fixes ported over from Firefox
(bug #s 991981, 995679, 999651, 1009952, 1011007)<br>
          <br>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> 24.4.0 (2014-03-10) </h3>
This update changes the new title behavior slightly and updates a lot
of things under-the-hood.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>By popular request: the new page title (when using the Pale
Moon App button) will now follow the operating system default alignment
(in most cases), meaning it will align left on Windows Vista and
Windows 7 by default instead of center. If you want to hide the title
or align it differently, please see the <a
 href="http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=3766"
 target="_blank">FAQ section on the forum</a>. </li>
        <li>Updated status bar code to the latest "non-australis"
version and license change to MPL 2.0 to bring it in line with the rest
of the browser code, making it an integral part of the source tree to
streamline building (also for 3rd parties).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Changed the way Pale Moon handles file and protocol
associations. This will prevent interoperability issues if you have
both Firefox and Pale Moon installed on the same system. A side effect
is that Pale Moon will ask you (once) to make it the default browser
again when you install this update, because of the new associations to
be made.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Changed the search default to DuckDuckGo. </li>
        <li>Added DuckDuckGo logo to about:home. </li>
        <li>Changed some things in the build system, back-end code and
build configuration to improve overall performance of the browser.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Switched to the use of a more compact browser filesystem
layout, improving overall start-up speed.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Precompiled script cache in the application, improving
overall start-up speed at the expense of some disk space.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added MPS detection for non-windows operating systems (NSPR
fallback method) instead of always "1". </li>

      <h3> 24.3.1 (2014-01-31) </h3>
A minor bugfix release to address some issues with new code in 24.3.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fine-tuned the title-bar title text position to work a

the pm4linux project.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 24.3.0 (2014-01-28) </h3>
A fairly significant update with feature updates, bugfixes, and
security fixes.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Changes and bugfixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li> <span class="c12">New build: Atom-optimized Pale Moon</span><br>
After some thorough testing, the Atom/netbook builds are being released
as final. These builds are specifically made for PCs with Intel Atom
processors. More information can be found on the <a
 href="palemoon-atom.shtml">Atom builds</a> page.<br>
        </li>
        <li> <span class="c12">New feature: the title has been brought
back to the title bar</span><br>
When using the Application Menu (Pale Moon button), the title bar of
the browser window would be blank. Considering this is wasted space,
the page title will now be displayed in the title bar again (it's
called a title bar for a reason, after all!). Several different styles
have been implemented to cater to different OS version layouts. </li>
        <li> <span class="c12">Removal of the services tab in the
Add-on Manager</span><br>
It will be visible only if someone actually has a service extension
installed (similar to how language packs work) </li>
        <li> <span class="c12">Improvement of UI consistency</span><br>
Removal of illogical selective hiding of the navigation bar and
toolbars when in tabs-on-top mode (Add-ons manager, permissions
manager, etc.). Browser chrome will now never be hidden. </li>
        <li> <span class="c12">Bugfix: When using the classic
downloads window, downloads in private windows were not shown</span><br>
If you use the classic downloads window and would open a Private
Browsing (PB) window, there was no easy way to see which downloads were
done in the PB window. When checking the downloads, it would open up
the (non-PB) classic downloads window which does not have downloads
listed from the PB session. This has been fixed, and PB windows will
now open a new tab in the PB window with the downloads from that
private session. </li>
        <li> <span class="c12">Bugfix: Geolocation didn't work in Pale
Moon</span><br>
This was caused by the Firefox standard geolocation provider (Google
Inc.) now requiring an API key to request geolocation coordinates. Only
official Mozilla Firefox builds will have working geolocation from
Google.<br>
Pale Moon has switched provider to IP-API.com to address this issue,
with the required re-write of code for the different type of request.

        <li> <span class="c12">Bugfix: The "More information" link for

        <li> <span class="c12">Bugfix: Certain scaled fonts would have
malformed letters<br>
          </span> On Vista and later with hardware acceleration
enabled, certain letters of some font families would become malformed
and difficult to read because of a Direct2D scaling issue. These fonts
should now render sharp and more legibly. </li>

bar localizations</span><br>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 24.2.2 (2013-12-11) </h3>
Mainly a security update:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementation of all remaining applicable security fixes
from Firefox 26.0 that were not implemented yet in previous versions.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Update of the Security library (NSS) to 3.15.3.1. </li>
        <li>Fix of new js zone writes/zone barrier bugs.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The Sync configuration allows users to input their own
recovery key again. Please note that letting the browser generate its
own secure recovery key is still strongly recommended, as this recovery
key should be impossible to guess and of sufficient length and
complexity to keep your data safely encrypted.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 24.2.1 (2013-12-04) </h3>
A minor bugfix update:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix for some status bar localizations not working and
giving an error. </li>
        <li>Implementation of an optimized QuickFind routine. </li>
        <li>Implementation of per-zone user data handling.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Security fix in the JPEG library. </li>
        <li>Security fix in web workers.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 24.2.0 (2013-11-26) </h3>
This update implements the following changes:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Update of the new-tab routine: When opening a new tab,
focus will now only be on the address bar if you open a blank tab or
the Quick Dial page, and focus will be on the page content otherwise
(Pale Moon start page or custom URL). </li>
        <li>Compatibility issues between QuickFind/Find-as-you-Type and
HTML5 input fields in forms fixed.<br>
        </li>
        <li>New advanced feature: Later versions of the Firefox code
will automatically place the browser window fully on a visible portion
of the screen. If you prefer having the browser window positioned
partially off-screen and want to prevent this automatic resizing and
repositioning when starting a new session, create a new boolean
preference in about:config called <span class="c13">browser.sessionstore.exactPos</span>
and set it to <span class="c13">true</span>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the localization of the status bar code with the
following locales: en-GB, es-MX, es-AR, it, pl. </li>
        <li>Fix for a security issue with script event handlers.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 24.1.2 (2013-11-19) </h3>
This update implements the following changes:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Update of the NSPR library to 4.10.2 RTM. </li>
        <li>Update of the Security library (NSS) to 3.15.3 (alternative
branch) to pick up a number of fixes. </li>
        <li>Fix (finally) of the menu list of tabs when <span
 class="c8">browser.allTabs.previews</span> is set to <span class="c8">false</span>.
It would stick the top entry, not properly highlight the selected tab,
and would generally be unpleasant and stubborn when tabs were moved or
closed. This should all be corrected now. </li>
        <li>Additional feature: Previously, tabs would immediately
resize to fill the tab bar when you would close them. Mozilla changed
this a (long) while back to cater to "rapidly closing multiple tabs
without moving the mouse" and to resize you have to move the mouse out
of the tab bar. A good number of Firefox/Pale Moon users don't like
this behavior, but the fix to make this configurable was in the end
rejected by the Mozilla UX team, so I opted for my own implementation
in Pale Moon. New pref: <span class="c8">browser.tabs.resize_immediately</span>
- set this preference to <span class="c8">true</span> to immediately
resize other tabs when closing a tab.<br>
          <span class="c2">Many thanks to David</span> for doing the
required research for this feature!<br>
        </li>
        <li>Rework of the multi-core routine and removal of OpenMP code
and the related library (Microsoft's implementation is old, limited,
and won't be updated/improved; in addition it prevented some compiler
optimizations that could now be used again). </li>
        <li>The accessibility back-end for automatically starting "Find
as you type" (an accessibility feature) has been disabled completely to
prevent this setting from breaking websites with HTML5 input fields
(not compatible with autostarting FAYT).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 24.1.1 (2013-11-05) </h3>
This is a minor update to 24.1.0 to revert the change of disabling 2
specific SSL ciphers by default, since it broke more web sites than
anticipated (including external elements pulled in from third-party
sites using SSL). No other changes were made.<br>
      <h3> 24.1.0 (2013-11-04) </h3>
This update fixes a number of security and user interface issues, and
adds the feed icon in the address bar.<br>

      <span class="c2">Changes:<br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>Extensions are now set to automatically update by default.
Because many users fail to do the occasional check to see if there are
updates available to their extensions, the default is to automatically
check and install available updates to extensions from this version
forward to give the best possible browsing experience. <span class="c2">If
you prefer to check manually, make sure to change the setting
accordingly in your add-on manager.</span> </li>
        <li>Two SSL ciphers that are considered weak are disabled by
default (RSA-RC4-128-MD5 and RSA-RC4-128-SHA). If you are having
trouble reaching certain encrypted sites that <span class="c7">exclusively</span>
use these encryption methods, <span class="c2">you should ask the site
owners to update their SSL configuration to allow stronger encryption.</span>
As a <span class="c2">workaround</span>, you can enable the ciphers by
installing the <a href="http://www.palemoon.org/commander.shtml"
 class="postlink">Pale Moon Commander add-on</a> and changing the
available ciphers there, or by setting <span class="c14">security.ssl3.rsa_rc4_128_md5</span>
and <span class="c14">security.ssl3.rsa_rc4_128_sha</span> to <span
 class="c14">true</span> in <span class="c15">about:config<br>
          </span> <span class="c16">(Note: this change was reverted in
24.1.1)</span><br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c2">New Features:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>When there is a <a class="c17"
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">web feed</a> available on
a website, Pale Moon will now display a feed indicator on the right
side of the address bar to indicate that feeds are available. You can
click this icon to subscribe to feeds.<br>
If you don't want this indicator, set <span class="c18">browser.urlbar.rss</span>
to <span class="c18">false</span> in about:config<br>

      </ul>
      <h3> 24.0.2 (2013-09-27) </h3>
This is a small update to address a few issues with standalone images:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>In some cases when having an image open, the User Interface
would not properly redraw resulting in blank controls and tab headers. </li>
        <li>In some cases, having an image open would cause 100%
processor use on one core. </li>
        <li>Drawing thumbnails of standalone images in the tab headers
would often be slow and processor-intensive. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 24.0.1 (2013-09-18) </h3>
This is a small update to address some small issues with the new major
version:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix for unreadable address bar text when visiting a broken
or mixed-mode SSL site. </li>
        <li>Fix for an incorrect browser cache size default when first
starting the browser. <span class="c7">(regression)</span><br>
Note: If you have used version 24.0, then <span class="c2">please check</span>
your Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Network tab, and if the cache size is
set to "1024", <span class="c2">change it back to its default "250"</span>
to prevent unnecessary use of disk space and potential slowing of the
browser. </li>
        <li>Fix for themes not applying to Private Browsing windows. <span
 class="c7">(regression)</span> </li>
        <li>A small update to the new icon to fix some visual issues
with it. </li>
        <li>Reduction of visual friction and CPU usage on some
operations by disabling smooth scrolling on it by default (e.g.
Home/End keys).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 24.0 (2013-09-13) </h3>
This is a new major release with many changes and improvements. A <span
 class="c19">concise</span> summary of the changes follows. There are
too many changes and updates (both resulting from the code base update
and from the additional Pale Moon development on top) to list all of
them in detail.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Switch to a new Mozilla code base (Gecko 24.0). </li>
        <li>Update of the Pale Moon icon/logo. Special thanks go to <span
 id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps">Roger</span> <span
 class="hps">Gómez del</span> <span class="hps">Casal for providing me
with an interesting concept design image to use as a base for it!<br>
          </span></span> </li>
        <li>Fixes for all relevant <a
 href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox.html">
security vulnerabilities.</a> </li>
        <li>Many changes and updates in the rendering, scripting and
parsing back-end to provide significant improvements in overall browser
performance (including benchmark scores). </li>
        <li>Addition of a number of HTML5 elements, improving overall
HTML5 standards compliance.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Implementation of the webaudio API (most features that are
no longer draft). </li>
        <li>Removal of Tab Groups (Panorama). If you actively used this
functionality, I have also made an <a
 href="http://storage.sity.nl/palemoon/support/palemoon-tabgroups-0.2.xpi">add-on</a>
(Mozilla dev sourced) available to restore this feature to the browser.
If you have issues with the supplied add-on or want to give other tab
grouping methods a try, you can use alternatives found on <a
 target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">AMO</a>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removal of a few additional Accessibility options.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Inclusion of an updated version of the Add-on SDK and
loader to solve recent issues with SDK/Jetpack add-ons. </li>
        <li>Adjustment of the Quickdial "new tab" feature to have
better layout. </li>
        <li>Extension of the address bar shading functionality to more
clearly indicate when there is a problem with a secure site (red
shading on broken SSL/mixed content).<br>
        </li>
        <li>New way of handling plugins with control on a per-site
basis. An extensive description can be found <a
 href="http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=3031"
 target="_blank">on the forum</a>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Restored/maintained a number of features that were removed
from recent Firefox versions: </li>
        <li class="c3">
          <ul>
            <li>Graphical tab switching feature with quick search
(Ctrl+Shift+Tab). </li>
            <li>Removing the tab bar if there is only one tab present.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Options for the loading of images. </li>
            <li>More recovery options in the Safe Mode startup dialog
box than just nuking your profile.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Send Link/E-mail Link mail client integration
functionality. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Unification of version numbers. x86 and x64 will from this
point forward use the same version number (and icon) without an
architecture designation. This will solve potential compatibility
issues on new major versions, as well as the superfluous compatibility
check when switching between x86 and x64 on the same profile. </li>
      </ul>
      <h1> Release notes for version 20 </h1>
      <h3> 20.3 (2013-08-13) </h3>
This update addresses performance/resource use and also tackles some
security vulnerabilities.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>A change to how tab histories are cached to improve the
overall memory footprint and make browsing smoother, especially when
using a large number of tabs with extensive active use. </li>
        <li>A change to the networking pipelining back-end to use a
more aggressive fallback if there are issues with pipelining requests,
to minimize delays when loading pages and prevent time-outs. </li>
        <li>Update of the compiler to Visual Studio 2012 Update 3, to
fix a few compiler issues. </li>
        <li>Removed the double entry for smooth scrolling selection in
preferences (leaving just the one in the scrolling tab)<br>

A small update to address issues with the new Aero glass theme, e.g.
Tab Groups not showing.<br>
      <h3> 20.2 (2013-07-01) </h3>
This is a maintenance update, focusing on visual improvements and
security.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementation of some conservative additional multi-core
support (mainly in graphics/media) using OpenMP. I'm taking baby steps
here and will remain conservative in the use of multiple cores so
stability of the browser isn't needlessly endangered.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Update of the navigation button icons (again). Users have
clearly indicated that the inverted color icons on glass and dark
themes were less desirable. I've listened, and changed the icons for
glass back to the pre-20 style but with added contrast, and made a
distinction for dark personas (themes) where the icons are now simply
inverted white (like in Firefox). </li>
        <li>Change for the color management system (CMS) so that Pale
Moon now supports more types of embedded ICC profiles (including the
already decade-old version 4 spec) and in the process fixing potential
color issues on screens with images that embed such profiles. </li>
        <li>Update of the browser padlock code. You can now choose both
a "modern" look (as introduced in version 19) and a "classic" look (as
introduced in version 15, when this padlock feature was first added).
It also removes some phantom spacing in locations where the padlock
isn't used (thanks for the pointer, Sowmoots!). </li>

      <h3> 15.1.1 </h3>
This is a minor update to address some important performance (high CPU
usage) and stability (browser hang) issues in Pale Moon 15.1.
Specifically, some of Tete009's patches were backed out.<br>
Azure acceleration with his patches is still in place, but the
multi-threaded box blur and cairo patches were removed to fix the CPU
and browser hang issues, respectively.<br>
      <h3> 15.1 </h3>
This is a major update to the new v15.0 release, to address a fairly
large number of issues with the initial version.<br>

To keep these release notes concise, this is just a plain list of
changes. You are encouraged to read the <a
 href="http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=1414">extended
changelog post</a> on the Pale Moon forum if you have any questions or
want clarification about any of the items mentioned.<br>
      <h3> 15.0 </h3>
This is a new release based on the Gecko 15.0 code base with additional
branch development. It incorporates many changes under the hood that go
far beyond the scope of this document.<br>
      <br>
A few highlights, in addition to security fixes:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Performance improvements for the rendering engine </li>
        <li>More HTML 5 implemented<br>
        </li>
        <li>Better handling of memory, resulting in smoother operation
of the browser </li>
        <li>More responsive user interface when the browser is busy<br>
        </li>
        <li>Prevention of memory leaks through add-ons </li>
        <li>Better implementation of the Quickdial page </li>
        <li>Localization of Pale Moon specific preferences and options
(work in progress) </li>
        <li>Reinstatement of the previous user interface, keeping it in
line with version 12 (Firefox 15 has UI changes that makes the controls
flat, monochrome and borderless, which isn't desired for Pale Moon)<br>
        </li>
        <li>The padlock has returned for secure pages! It can be found
in front of the URL when you browse to a secure page, with optionally
company information if supplied by the server </li>
      </ul>
Some things new to the Firefox code base that are <span class="c2">excluded</span>
or disabled by default:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Built-in PDF reader in javascript - use a standalone,
dedicated reader<br>
(this is both a security and functionality consideration)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Additional advanced web development tools - the average
user <span class="c7">never</span> needs these<br>
        </li>
        <li>Web apps on the desktop - Pale Moon is a browser, not a
pseudo-OS<br>
        </li>
        <li>Windows Metro UI </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h1> Release notes for version 12<br>
      </h1>
      <h3> 12.3 r2 </h3>
This is a rebuild of Pale Moon 12.3 to address some performance
regression in the 32-bit version of Pale Moon 12.3. No functional
changes have been implemented in this release, and updating the browser
is completely optional, but recommended if you experience lesser
performance in Pale Moon 12.3 than you are used to.<br>
This build should give overall smoother operation of the browser and
better HTML5 video playback (WebM/Theora) than the original release.<br>
      <br>
Note: once again, this is to address a regression that was <span
 class="c2">only</span> present in the 32-bit (x86) version of Pale
Moon 12.3 and does <span class="c2">not</span> affect Pale Moon x64.
Pale Moon 12.3r2 is an <span class="c2">update for the 32-bit version
only and completely optional</span> if you are already on v12.3.<br>
      <h3> 12.3 </h3>
This is a maintenance release to address a number of potential security
vulnerabilities.<br>
      <br>
Most notably among them:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Use-after-free while replacing/inserting a node in a
document </li>
        <li>Content Security Policy inline-script bypass </li>
        <li>A few additional memory safety hazards and crashes that
could theoretically be exploited </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c2">Additional note:</span> the initial binaries
as-published had a missing component that caused saving of a session to
malfunction and not properly restore. If you have downloaded 12.3 x86
between 12:00 and 17:00 Central European Summer Time (Z+2) on
17/7/2012, or x64 on the same day between 12:00 and 19:00, you may have
a faulty browser and you should download and re-install the browser.
Apologies for the inconvenience!<br>
      <h3> 12.2.1 </h3>
A minor update to fix stability issues:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix for Flash 11.3 crashing the plugin container or browser
upon shutdown.<br>
          <span class="c2">Note:</span> Flash 11.3 introduces
"protected mode", an internal plugin sandbox, that can still cause
other issues, e.g. for full-screen video playback. Please check the <a
 href="http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=922">forum
announcement</a> for more information, workarounds and advice if you
experience issues. </li>
        <li>Fix for double entries for "recent tags" and "recently
bookmarked" in the bookmarks menu on a new profile. </li>
        <li>Fix for build instability issues in javascript due to the
Microsoft compiler producing incorrect machine code in some cases. This
fix will cause a slight performance loss on 32-bit builds to prevent
crashes and scripting problems in the GUI and on web pages. Pale Moon
x64 is not affected.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 12.2 </h3>
A minor update but introducing some new features.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Most important changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Privacy issue: clear the QuickDial page when history is
cleared </li>
        <li>Better, neutral background color for raw image viewing </li>
        <li>Smooth scrolling improved; also disabled smooth scrolling
for page-by-page by default<br>
        </li>
        <li>Smooth scrolling can now be configured/tuned in detail in
Advanced Options </li>
        <li>Some changes to the build method for x64 for potentially
better performance on some systems<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 12.1 </h3>
A major update to the browser, implementing a number of visual and
under-the-hood changes.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li> <a
 href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=745580"
 target="_blank">Bug #745580</a> Thebes: handle bad results from Core
Text shaping more robustly. </li>
        <li> <a
 href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=744541"
 target="_blank">Bug #744541</a> XPCOM i/o: Charset conversion issue. </li>
        <li> <a
 href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748613"
 target="_blank">Bug #748613</a> Javascript: Scope vulnerability </li>
        <li> <a
 href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=747688"
 target="_blank">Bug #747688</a> Layout engine: Drop references for all
destroyed frames </li>
        <li>Security update of the included MSVC runtime libraries </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c2">Enhancements and fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamic smooth scrolling algorithm for mouse/keyboard
implemented. Smooth scrolling is now also enabled by default. </li>
        <li>Update to the status bar code to fix pop-up status not
switching sides on mouse-over, as well as using a safer
allocation/destruction mechanism for controls (potentially preventing
memory leaks). </li>
        <li>Fixed: cache size override on new profiles (would be set to
1GB instead of the application default of 200MB). Bug <a
 href="http://www.palemoon.org/bugs/20120512-GNBug.html">20120512-GN</a>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Addition of a number of preferences in the Tabs category of
the options dialog box: </li>
        <li class="c3">
          <ul>
            <li>A checkbox for inserting related tabs next to the
current tab when opening a link; </li>
            <li>A checkbox for closing the browser window when the last
tab is closed; </li>
            <li>A selection for new tabs: Choose from a blank page, the
Pale Moon start page or the Quickdial page.<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Some slight color has been re-introduced in the navigation
elements to improve clarity of the UI. </li>
        <li>Disabled an image decoding library with hazardous code.
This has no impact on the browser's image decoding capabilities or
performance as alternative methods for decoding are used by default. </li>
        <li>Some changes to memory handling which potentially keep
memory use better within bounds. </li>
        <li>A change to the build environment to improve stability of
Javascript. Note that this is a trade-off and may result in a slight
drop in synthetic benchmarking performance of the browser compared to
the previous version of Pale Moon. The impact of this on overall
real-world performance of the browser is negligible.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 12.0 </h3>
A new release built on the Firefox 12 code base. This is mostly a
maintenance release.<br>
Of special interest is that Pale Moon, unlike Mozilla Firefox in its
version 12, does <span class="c7">not</span> move to a silent install
method.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">Fixes and changes in all versions:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>A number of security and stability fixes imported from
Firefox 12 </li>
        <li>Update to the status bar code and a finalization of the
integration of this functionality </li>
        <li>Localization of the status bar preferences and messages
into 3 additional common languages: German, French and Spanish. This
will automatically follow your locale setting </li>
        <li>Update to the HTML5 media controls </li>
        <li>Some under-the-hood changes that will further improve
performance of Pale Moon on <span class="c7">some</span> systems </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c2">Pale Moon Portable:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>An update to the launcher and script. More information on
the <a href="palemoon-portable.shtml" target="_blank">Pale Moon
Portable page</a>. It is recommended for everyone using the portable to
make a fresh install (with a copy over of your profile files if
desired) and not use an in-place upgrade. </li>
        <li>A fix for backups not being properly created and stored<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c2">This version marks the start of a different
release schedule for Pale Moon.</span><br>
      <br>
Instead of following the rapid release schedule of Mozilla, the browser
will use version 12, a properly matured build with essential
functionality, as a base to make incremental updates upon.<br>
      <br>
The reasons for this are multiple, not in the least it will allow Pale
Moon to implement things that have been on the "to-do" list for a while
but which have been pushed back because of lack of time "keeping up"
with the (too) fast releases of new versions by Mozilla. The rapid
releases often little more than maintenance updates and one or two new
features (sometimes even just partially implemented), but requiring a
full development/testing cycle for Pale Moon because of the
lumped-together patches. Another reason is that from this point on,
Firefox will receive a few user interface overhauls to go off on the
"Web OS"/"Metro"/"Desktop integration" tangent that goes against Pale
Moon's goals of being and remaining a web browser.<br>
      <br>
      <h1> Release notes for version 11<br>
      </h1>
      <h3> 11.0.1 </h3>
A small maintenance release to address a few annoyances in the original
new release of v11.0:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Tone down the rather too aggressive network settings that
were introduced in Firefox 11:<br>
          <ol>
            <li>Maximum concurrent connections opened by Pale Moon
lowered to 48 (was 256) to make sure it doesn't easily saturate the
networking layer of Windows, to prevent residential NAT gateways from
being overloaded and to lower strain on wireless networks </li>
            <li>Maximum concurrent connections to a single server
lowered to 6 (was 15). In tandem with pipelining this is still plenty,
and it actually promotes the proper intended use of pipelining </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Fix the installer to properly check for the minimum
required operating system version: Windows XP for both x86 and x64
versions </li>
        <li>Switch off OpenGL as preferred engine for WebGL again to
fix compatibility problems </li>
        <li>Switch off DirectWrite font rendering again to fix
compatibility issues with certain graphics cards </li>
        <li>Properly implement the removal/blocking of status bar
add-ons when upgrading/installing </li>
      </ul>
In addition, Pale Moon 11 will:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Save open session information less often (once a minute) </li>
        <li>No longer store form data and other entered information in
the browser session store when pages are viewed over SSL, to increase
security - the data entered in secure pages is no longer committed to
disk. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 11.0 </h3>
A new major release building on the Firefox 11.0 code base. This sees
many, many bugfixes and a good number of performance improvements that
would be too extensive to list in detail.<br>
      <h4> In summary </h4>
      <span class="c2">All versions:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Integration of the Status Bar functionality. You can now
access the status bar configuration directly from the Tools or Options
menu, and it is no longer a separate add-on<small><sup><a
 href="knownissues.shtml#Pale_Moon_status_bar_add-on">[note]</a></sup></small><br>
        </li>
        <li>Implementation of the SPDY protocol to improve load times
on websites that support it </li>
        <li>Improvements to the rendering engine, and specific
improvements to the hardware acceleration of font rendering and WebGL </li>
        <li>Implementation of more advanced HTML5 (including IndexedDB
improvements and support for more HTML5 elements) and CSS features
(including CSS 3D transforms) </li>
        <li>Add-on compatibility: add-ons now default to being
compatible </li>
        <li>Cosmetic updates to the Pale Moon icon and some included
artwork </li>
        <li>The (limited feature) web developer tools as added to
Firefox 11.0 have mostly been disabled since they are not intended to
be present in future builds of Pale Moon. Web developers are encouraged
to make their own choices about which development tools they wish to
use at the <a
 href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/collections/mozilla/webdeveloper/">Mozilla
Add-ons repository (Web development section)</a><br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c2">Pale Moon Portable:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>The automatic backup method has been simplified and the
resulting backups will take (a lot) less space. Bookmarks and passwords
are backed up, but history no longer gets backed up which saves many MB
on your stick or other portable medium </li>
        <li>Additional compression further reduces space requirements
for the 32-bit portable </li>
      </ul>
      <h1> Release notes for version 9<br>
      </h1>
      <h3> 9.2 </h3>
This update implements security fixes from Firefox up to 10.0.2 in
terms of security and stability.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix for a critical vulnerability in the libpng graphics
library </li>
        <li>Update to the add-ons blocklist and its handling </li>
        <li>New 64-bit application icon (32-bit icon update in the next
version) </li>
        <li>Minor updates to cache handling settings<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 9.1 </h3>
This update implements relevant fixes from Firefox 10 in terms of
security and stability. Additional new functionality found in Firefox
10 has not been implemented.<br>
In addition, the following fixes:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Update to the status bar component to fix pop-up status and
links, as well as a few other small issues </li>
        <li>Update to the add-on compatibility assistant to no longer
display the status bar core add-on as selectable </li>
        <li>Update to a few default settings based on usage metrics </li>
        <li>Removed some commercial search engines (e.g. Amazon) and
added <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>/SSL<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 9.0.1 </h3>
An update incorporating the Firefox 9.0.1 code base.<br>
In addition, the following changes:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Under the hood changes and improvements to the way memory
is handled by the Javascript engine </li>
        <li>WebGL has been changed to use ANGLE by default instead of
using native OpenGL to give better performance on a number of systems
that would otherwise suffer from high CPU usage and lower frame rates </li>
        <li>Change in compiler: from this point on, Visual Studio 2010
will be used for all "next gen" builds </li>
        <li>Build environment changed to cater to the ever-growing XUL
dll size without having to compromize on what modules to optimize.
(Prevent running into the 3GB address space limit)<br>
        </li>
        <li>DNS prefetching disabled by default to prevent router
hangups </li>
        <li>Changes to timings for UI script execution and content
script execution to prevent unnecessary dialog popups about
unresponsive scripts </li>
        <li>Some image decoding tweaks </li>
        <li>Eye candy: animated preferences dialogs (resize when
switching category) </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 9.0 </h3>
Development version (unreleased).<br>
This version was not considered acceptable for release due to
performance regressions.<br>
      <h1> Release notes for version 8<br>
      </h1>
      <h3> 8.0 </h3>
A major update building on the Firefox 8.0 code base, with improvements
that were planned for the (unreleased) version 7.0.2.<br>
This version sees the following improvements in addition to those
inherent to Firefox 8:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved cache handling: this will make the browser handle
system resources more efficiently on most systems </li>
        <li>Improved networking: communication with web servers should
be noticeably faster and smoother </li>
        <li>Fix for a rare image decoding bug (garbage, possible
crashes) </li>
      </ul>
It should be noted that the shift in focus of development has been
towards the back-end of the browser (background resource handling and
background networking), considering the rendering and scripting speed
is not the bottleneck for current versions of the browser. Inherently,
this <span class="c7">may</span> result in less of a clear difference
in benchmark scores when comparing to its vulpine sibling or previous
versions of Pale Moon because of rebalancing of code priority when
building. Maximum benchmark scores are nice, of course, but the main
goal of Pale Moon remains to be as efficient as possible <span
 class="c7">when taken as a whole</span>, including those parts that <span
 class="c7">aren't</span> measured in limited benchmark tests.<br>
      <h1> Release notes for version 7<br>
      </h1>
      <h3> 7.0.1 </h3>
This update fixes a very important speed regression issue for Pale Moon
7.0. It impacts mostly the page content layout engine and DOM handling,
which will be on par again with what they should be for Pale Moon in
this point release. Bug: <a href="bugs/20111001-CCBug.shtml">20111001-CCBug</a><br>
Benchmarking scores will see a significant jump from 7.0 to 7.0.1 as a
result, as well.<br>
There are no other functional or UI changes for this release.<br>
      <h3> 7.0 </h3>
A new release building on the Firefox 7.0.1 code base. This version
sees a <span class="c2">large</span> number of performance increases,
as well as lower resource use than the previous version.<br>
      <br>
Additional changes:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduction of the Tab Groups (panorama) button in the
user interface for easy access (Next to the All Tabs button) </li>
        <li>Several additional performance improvements on individual
browser components </li>
        <li>A change of the Application Menu button color to blue
shades instead of a "foxy orange"<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1> Release notes for version 6<br>
      </h1>
      <h3> 6.0.2 </h3>
A security update seeing the following changes:<br>
      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>Removed trust exceptions for certain certificates (<a
 href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=683449">bug 683449</a>)
        </li>
        <li>Resolved an issue with gov.uk websites (<a
 href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=669792">bug 669792</a>)
        </li>
        <li>Revoked permissions for the root certificate for DigiNotar
in the built-in certificate store (<a
 href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=682927">bug 682927</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
In addition, there has been some work done on the x64 build method to
prepare for performance fixes in a future release.<br>
      <br>
      <h3> 6.0 </h3>
New release based on Firefox 6.0!<br>
Of course the necessary bugfixes and changes as part of the new code
base, with a number of additional changes:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Add-ons will no longer automatically update by default the
moment they are checked and found to have a newer release, giving the
user the choice to accept or reject the update, read release notes,
etc. </li>
        <li>Update of the status bar add-on to v2.2, fixing
compatibility issues and extending some configurability </li>
        <li>Link right-click menu has "Open in new tab" on top now,
like Firefox. If you are having trouble retraining yourself for this

      <h3> 4.0 </h3>
This is a brand new release!<br>
      <br>
Built on Gecko 2.0, the browser has the following new features:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Hardware acceleration of browser windows using Direct3D </li>
        <li>Direct2D rendering on operating systems and hardware that
support it </li>
        <li>DirectWrite font rendering on systems that support it </li>
        <li>WebGL 3D graphics, either using native OpenGL (default) or
DirectX (via ANGLE)<br>
        </li>
        <li>HTML5 support </li>
        <li>New Jaegermonkey javascript engine </li>
        <li>Blazingly fast DOM handling </li>
      </ul>
Of course, the well known features from version 3.x are still present,
as well:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Graphical tab previews (on a nice glass pane if you have
Windows 7) with search </li>
        <li>Dynamic/downloadable fonts (including WOFF) </li>
        <li>Support for personas and Firefox themes </li>
        <li>Support for Firefox 4 compatible add-ons </li>
        <li>Support for OOPP (Out-of-process plug-ins) </li>
        <li>Able to use existing Firefox profiles, bookmarks and
settings (either using the migration tool or using Sync)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
Since this is a new release, it may be a little less stable than the
tried-and-tested 3.x releases, but no major issues have been found thus
far.<br>
