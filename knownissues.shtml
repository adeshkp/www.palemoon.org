      <h3> Development notes<br>
      </h3>
The Pale Moon browser, at any point in time, may have a number of known
issues. These known issues will usually be addressed in the next
release of the browser, or it may be something that people have noticed
and are mentioned here because they are <span class="bydesign">"by
design"</span>, i.e.: issues people have asked about, are known, and
are this way on purpose.<br>
For each issue, check the status for intended action to be taken in
development (if any) and intended time line (if applicable).<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="bold">Known issues in the current version:</span><br>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="c4">Remote X rendering on Linux is slow</span><br>
We are currently investigating the exact cause, and have received
offers to assist by the X2Go team to find the cause and solutions for
slow remote rendering, even with xrender extensions present and in use.
This may take some time to research and for a fix to be implemented and
tested.<br>

These directories are related to the underlying Mozilla extension code (<span

extension IDs there. This issue is completely harmless and
non-breaking; in fact, having (all) Mozilla-based applications use this
one central location for extension IDs is desired.<br>
