      <h3> Development notes<br>
      </h3>
The Pale Moon browser, at any point in time, may have a number of known
issues. These known issues will usually be addressed in the next
release of the browser, or it may be something that people have noticed
and are mentioned here because they are <span class="bydesign">"by
design"</span>, i.e.: issues people have asked about, are known, and
are this way on purpose.<br>
For each issue, check the status for intended action to be taken in
development (if any) and intended time line (if applicable).<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="bold">Known issues in the current version:</span><br>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 153);">Some
media+MSE combinations don't work.</span><br>
Our new asynchronous MSE code is not yet implemented for WebM, meaning
you cannot play WebM through MSE delivery with the new code.<br>
We are working on completing this media code. In the meantime, if you
need MSE+WebM video, in Options -&gt; Content, deselect "Use MSE
asynchronously", and then select "Enable MSE for WebM video".<br>

some configurations, the browser may crash on shutdown.</span><br>
It seems to be especially the case if the Firefox version of
GreaseMonkey (1.15) is installed instead of our Pale Moon fork of it.<br>
The crash has been pinpointed to our latest NSS library update.<br>
We are currently investigating the exact cause of this, and will be
backing out the NSS update (as well as disabling TLS 1.3 draft support
since the draft supported by the older NSS version is going to be
obsolete very soon) to resolve the crashes in the next point release.<br>

At 125% or 150% scaling of visual elements in Display Options in
Windows, the borders of tabs may be drawn thicker than intended in the
default theme.<br>
This is a side-effect of the natural border size rounding introduced in
Pale Moon 27.7.0 combined with non-standard styling of tabs in our UI.
This needs some tweaking of our default theme.<br>

On some sites, video playback is problematic. This is generally caused
by Media Source Extensions being in use. While we are working on
aligning this to the spec and behavior of other browsers, some sites
may still cause issues, like refusal to play, video/audio de-sync, or
other issues that prevent proper playback of video in the web browser.<br>

On some machine/operating system combinations, the browser may hang
when using media-heavy sites like Facebook and YouTube. This is
especially likely on those systems if you switch away from the site for
a time, then return to the tab of the site. Forcefully closing the Pale
Moon process may be the only way to recover.<br>
This is a rather complex bug in the media back-end (mostly because
media playback is asynchronous and uses multiple threads).<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Potential workarounds</span>:
using a tab unloader extension like BarTab, disabling autoplay of
