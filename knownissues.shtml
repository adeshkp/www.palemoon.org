              Development notes<br>
            </h3>The Pale Moon browser, at any point in time, may have a number of known issues. These known issues
            will usually be addressed in the next release of the browser, or it may be something that people have
            noticed and are mentioned here because they are <span class="bydesign">"by design"</span>, i.e.: issues people
            have asked about, are known, and are this way on purpose.<br>
            For each issue, check the status for intended action to be taken in development (if any) and intended
            timeline (if applicable).<br>
            <br>

Pale Moon 27 will not convert your stored passwords properly (because a
new storage file already exists).<br>

explicitly rely on this and that do not properly check for this feature

the server side, will fail to function properly (and in some cases even

Windows XP users who have hacked their OS with a registry hack to
supposedly "get continued security updates" from Microsoft past the
end-of-life date for Windows XP in 2014, by tricking the Windows Update
servers into thinking that they are running Windows Embedded (a bad
thing to do, see articles on <a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-warns-against-registry-hack-that-allows-windows-xp-updates" target="_blank">Neowin</a>, <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-hack-windows-xp-registry-embedded,26882.html" target="_blank">Tom's Hardware</a> and <a href="http://betanews.com/2014/05/27/microsoft-warns-against-xp-update-hack-suggests-users-upgrade-to-windows-8-1-instead/" target="_blank">Betanews</a>) will be unable to start the browser.<br>
This is caused by a sanity check in the browser for supported operating
systems (since we do not support point-of-sale or embedded Windows
versions due to technical compatibility issues with those SKUs) to
prevent problems on platforms that are not a valid target for Pale Moon.<br>
By user request, we've decided to remove this check with the clear
responsibility for support being shifted to end-users. You are on your
own when not running a straight-up retail/OEM Windows XP.<br>

                The vulnerability patch was adapted to allow for cookies to be stored by authenticating proxies, but
                not on proxy connection failures, greatly reducing the available scenarios for this already difficult

                If you are using Windows 7 SP1 with the (Feb 28<sup>th</sup> 2013) Windows Platform Update (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2670838">KB 2670838</a>), or potentially also if you are using Windows
                8/8.1, and your system is equipped with a certain legacy ATI/AMD Radeon (specifically an HD3000 or
                HD4000 series) graphics processor, you may encounter issues with rendering text and graphics in page

                <img class="c13" alt="" src="images/bug812695.png"><br>
                This is caused by the combination of OS, the Platform Update which makes changes to DirectX, and the
                graphics hardware/drivers in your system. Unfortunately, it's not clear who exactly is to blame, as
                people keep pointing fingers to others (Microsoft, AMD, Mozilla). Note that the update may also have
                been installed as a prerequisite for using MSIE 10/11.<br>
                Of note: Later versions of Pale Moon are less likely to display this error than Firefox, but it

                On some installations, the download manager panel may possibly pop up on the bottom left of the browser
                instead of where the download manager button is. This is caused by a small issue in the default set of
                controls in the v24.4.0 updated status bar code, confusing the panel by having 2 places to "hang" the
                panel from.<br>
                I will be fixing this by removing the status bar download control from the "default" set of controls

                (non-PB) classic downloads window which does not have downloads listed from the PB session.<br>
                This is caused by PB windows being implemented after Mozilla moved to the panel-based downloads
                manager, and there is no check in the classic downloads window if it is called from a PB window or
