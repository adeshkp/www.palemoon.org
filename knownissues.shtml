              Development notes<br>
            </h3>The Pale Moon browser, at any point in time, may have a number of known issues. These known issues
            will usually be addressed in the next release of the browser, or it may be something that people have
            noticed and are mentioned here because they are <span class="bydesign">"by design"</span>, i.e.: issues people
            have asked about, are known, and are this way on purpose.<br>
            For each issue, check the status for intended action to be taken in development (if any) and intended
            timeline (if applicable).<br>
            <br>

We currently do not support a spec-compliant version of so-called

explicitly rely on this and that do not properly check for this feature
or don't provide one of the many polyfills for it that are available on
the server side, will fail to function properly (and in some cases even
completely fail to display).<br>

sites in turn (because the extension isn't implementing the entire spec, and
properly-detecting sites will assume promises are fully available)<br>

Windows XP users who have hacked their OS with a registry hack to
supposedly "get continued security updates" from Microsoft past the
end-of-life date for Windows XP in 2014, by tricking the Windows Update
servers into thinking that they are running Windows Embedded (a bad
thing to do, see articles on <a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-warns-against-registry-hack-that-allows-windows-xp-updates" target="_blank">Neowin</a>, <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-hack-windows-xp-registry-embedded,26882.html" target="_blank">Tom's Hardware</a> and <a href="http://betanews.com/2014/05/27/microsoft-warns-against-xp-update-hack-suggests-users-upgrade-to-windows-8-1-instead/" target="_blank">Betanews</a>) will be unable to start the browser.<br>
This is caused by a sanity check in the browser for supported operating
systems (since we do not support point-of-sale or embedded Windows
versions due to technical compatibility issues with those SKUs) to
prevent problems on platforms that are not a valid target for Pale Moon.<br>
By user request, we've decided to remove this check with the clear
responsibility for support being shifted to end-users. You are on your
own when not running a straight-up retail/OEM Windows XP.<br>

                does not allow auth cookies to pass through or be modified by proxies. This may make some SSO setups
                fail to authenticate to individual services (usually on corporate intranetworks that employ proxies)
                and as a result the user is asked to provide login details.<br>

                bugs.<br>
                The vulnerability patch was adapted to allow for cookies to be stored by authenticating proxies, but
                not on proxy connection failures, greatly reducing the available scenarios for this already difficult
                to practically exploit session fixation vulnerability. It should be sufficiently mitigated this way
                while not being in the way of legitimate cookie injection requests. In environments where this is a
                concern, the session policies should be revised or implemented in a different way.<br>

                If you are using Windows 7 SP1 with the (Feb 28<sup>th</sup> 2013) Windows Platform Update (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2670838">KB 2670838</a>), or potentially also if you are using Windows
                8/8.1, and your system is equipped with a certain legacy ATI/AMD Radeon (specifically an HD3000 or
                HD4000 series) graphics processor, you may encounter issues with rendering text and graphics in page
                content, similar to:<br>
                <img class="c13" alt="" src="images/bug812695.png"><br>
                This is caused by the combination of OS, the Platform Update which makes changes to DirectX, and the
                graphics hardware/drivers in your system. Unfortunately, it's not clear who exactly is to blame, as
                people keep pointing fingers to others (Microsoft, AMD, Mozilla). Note that the update may also have
                been installed as a prerequisite for using MSIE 10/11.<br>
                Of note: Later versions of Pale Moon are less likely to display this error than Firefox, but it

                On some installations, the download manager panel may possibly pop up on the bottom left of the browser
                instead of where the download manager button is. This is caused by a small issue in the default set of
                controls in the v24.4.0 updated status bar code, confusing the panel by having 2 places to "hang" the
                panel from.<br>
                I will be fixing this by removing the status bar download control from the "default" set of controls
                (like in previous versions).<br>
                <span class="bold">Workaround:</span> Open the customization window (right-click a toolbar button and

                Trying to open up the download manager (either panel or classic window) by clicking on the status bar

                If you use the classic downloads window and open a Private Browsing (PB) window, there is no easy way
                to see which downloads are done in the PB window. When checking the downloads, it will open up the
                (non-PB) classic downloads window which does not have downloads listed from the PB session.<br>
                This is caused by PB windows being implemented after Mozilla moved to the panel-based downloads
                manager, and there is no check in the classic downloads window if it is called from a PB window or
                regular window.<br>
