              Development notes<br>
            </h3>The Pale Moon browser, at any point in time, may have a number of known issues. These known issues
            will usually be addressed in the next release of the browser, or it may be something that people have
            noticed and are mentioned here because they are <span class="c2">"by design"</span>, i.e.: issues people
            have asked about, are known, and are this way on purpose.<br>
            For each issue, check the status for intended action to be taken in development (if any) and intended
            timeline (if applicable).<br>
            <br>

                Some elements of the browser (e.g. tooltips and some web page elements) use suboptimal font rendering.
                This is caused by a deep-rooted issue in the gecko graphics rendering back-end affecting all
                gecko-based browsers, that requires time to research.<br>
                Effects are only aesthetic in nature and non-breaking.<br>

              Known issues in previous versions

                <span class="c4">Android: using VPN connections may not work</span><br>
                If you are using a VPN connection on Android 5 (Lollipop), Pale Moon may not be able to resolve host
                names, leading to connectivity failures. This is caused by a known problem in the underlying Fennec
                code that caters to much older versions of Android and relies on functions that have been removed in
                Android 5.*<br>
                <span class="c3">Status:</span> <span class="c9">[Fixed]</span><br>
                <span class="c3">Workarounds:</span> Use local (on-device) DNS resolution with a DNS resolver, use a
                different browser for VPN use, or downgrade to Android 4.*<br>

                <span class="c4">Some Single-Sign-On (SSO) setups don't work</span><br>
                Because of a security vulnerability with authentication redirection (cookie injection) through proxies
                (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8639">CVE-2014-8639</a> <a href=
                "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2015-04/">MFSA2015-04</a>), Pale Moon currently
                does not allow auth cookies to pass through or be modified by proxies. This may make some SSO setups
                fail to authenticate to individual services (usually on corporate intranetworks that employ proxies)
                and as a result the user is asked to provide login details.<br>
                <span class="c3">Status:</span> <span class="c9">[Fixed]</span>, following the relevant Mozilla
                bugs.<br>
                The vulnerability patch was adapted to allow for cookies to be stored by authenticating proxies, but
                not on proxy connection failures, greatly reducing the available scenarios for this already difficult
                to practically exploit session fixation vulnerability. It should be sufficiently mitigated this way
                while not being in the way of legitimate cookie injection requests. In environments where this is a
                concern, the session policies should be revised or implemented in a different way.<br>
                <span class="c3">Workaround:</span> Avoid using proxies for SSO.

                <img class="c13" alt="" src="images/bug812695.png"><br>
                This is caused by the combination of OS, the Platform Update which makes changes to DirectX, and the

                people keep pointing fingers to others (Microsoft, AMD, Mozilla). Note that the update may also have

                <span class="c4">The download manager panel may pop up in the far bottom-left</span><br>
                On some installations, the download manager panel may possibly pop up on the bottom left of the browser
                instead of where the download manager button is. This is caused by a small issue in the default set of
                controls in the v24.4.0 updated status bar code, confusing the panel by having 2 places to "hang" the
                panel from.<br>
                I will be fixing this by removing the status bar download control from the "default" set of controls
                (like in previous versions).<br>
                <span class="c3">Workaround:</span> Open the customization window (right-click a toolbar button and
                select Customize... from the menu) and remove the download manager control you don't intend to use
                (either the button in the main navigation bar or the control in the status bar) by dragging it from the
                browser window to the customization window.<br>

                <span class="c4">Trying to open up the download manager from the download status control doesn't
                work</span><br>
                Trying to open up the download manager (either panel or classic window) by clicking on the status bar
                control for downloads does nothing. This is caused by a small issue in the newly updated status bar
                code in 24.4.0.<br>

                <span class="c4">When using the classic downloads window, downloads in private windows are not
                shown</span><br>
                If you use the classic downloads window and open a Private Browsing (PB) window, there is no easy way
                to see which downloads are done in the PB window. When checking the downloads, it will open up the
                (non-PB) classic downloads window which does not have downloads listed from the PB session.<br>
                This is caused by PB windows being implemented after Mozilla moved to the panel-based downloads
                manager, and there is no check in the classic downloads window if it is called from a PB window or
                regular window.<br>
                <span class="c3">Workaround:</span> In the PB window, open a new tab and type <span class=
                "c18">about:downloads</span> in the address bar<br>

                This is caused by the Firefox standard geolocation provider (Google Inc.) now requiring an API key to
                request geolocation coordinates. Only official Mozilla Firefox builds of the code will work.<br>
                Pale Moon will be switching provider to address this issue.<br>
