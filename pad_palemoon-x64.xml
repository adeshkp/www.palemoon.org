			<Char_Desc_2000>Pale Moon is an Open Source, Mozilla-derived web browser focusing on user customization, efficiency and ease of use. Make sure to get the most out of your browser!

Pale Moon offers you a browsing experience in a Goanna-based browser completely built from its own source with carefully selected features and optimizations to maximize the browser's speed, stability and user experience, while maintaining compatibility with many Firefox extensions you have come to love and rely on.

Pale Moon is a middle road, cutting away support for (by current standards) ancient systems to give you a browser that not only supports the wide variety of uses the Mozilla software offers, but also uses the capabilities of modern hardware to give you a fast, efficient browser. Using Pale Moon, you will have full freedom to customize the browser the way you want it, as user choice is one of the important goals of this browser.</Char_Desc_2000>
