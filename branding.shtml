              About the brand and copyright<br>
            </h3>The Pale Moon branding, logo, and project/product names are the Intellectual Property of M.C. Straver,
            the owner and lead developer of the project. Pale Moon is a Trademark ™ for the web browser and the usage
            rights of the name and logo are reserved by the owner.<br>
            All graphics related to it are author-rights protected, meaning as a general rule you are not allowed to
            use it without permission. However, to allow people to promote the browser and brand, these ownership
            rights are usually not enforced when used to refer to Pale Moon on other sites and locations.<br>
            <br>
            This means that for clarity, this page attempts to explain where the line is drawn, insofar as common sense
            would not already dictate.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>
              DOs and DON'Ts
            </h3>Perhaps the simplest way to set the general usage guidelines for the branding and logo is by listing a
            few things you can do and a few things you cannot do. These are examples and by no means definitive or
            all-inclusive. If you have any doubts about the use of the logo or branding/name in a certain context,
            please do get in touch to discuss potential usage <span class="c2">before</span> it is published,
            thanks.<br>
            <br>
            <span class="c4">DOs: You <span class="c3">are allowed</span> to:</span><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the Pale Moon name and logo on your own website if it refers directly to the browser. This

              <li>Redistribute your own build of the browser that does not carry the official name and logo (unofficial

            <h3>
              Promotional use of the Pale Moon name and/or logo
            </h3>As outlined above, you are allowed to use the Pale Moon™ brand name and/or logo for promotional
            purposes for the browser.<br>
            <br>
            Guidelines for use:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Preferred use of the logo is as a whole (round) logo, with optionally the wordmark ("Pale Moon") to
              the right of it (as on the website) or in smaller font, width-matched, immediately below it (as in
              about:logo).
              </li>
              <li>The logo should be displayed in its full color depth and original colors.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Alternative use is the top 1/3 to 1/2 of the logo as design permits or desires.
              </li>
              <li>The wordmark should be displayed in the chosen font (Museo, preferably Museo 500) and with one of the
              two preferred colors (#17109E or #244C8A) although small variations are permitted to cater to your page
              design. Museo 500 is a freely available web font (no-cost license).
              </li>
              <li>The name is "Pale Moon", not "Palemoon", "PaleMoon", "Pale-moon", "pale moon" or "palemoon". Please
              use the proper, 2-word, capitalized form.
              </li>
              <li>Using custom promotional slogans or catch phrases in relation to the browser without clearing those
              with the owner first is strongly discouraged, to prevent potentially undesired impressions to the public.
              If you wish to use a custom slogan/catch phrase in relation to the browser, that has not been officially
              published before, then please get in touch with the owner before publication to discuss.
              </li>
              <li>In general, it is not customary or required to include the Trademark ™ symbol when mentioning Pale
              Moon. For official documents it is, however, encouraged.<br>
              </li>
