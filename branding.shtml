      <h1>Pale Moon branding and promotional material<br>
      </h1>
      <h3>About the brand and copyright<br>
      </h3>
The
Pale Moon branding, logo, and project/product
names are the Intellectual Property of M.C. Straver, the owner and lead
developer of the project. Pale Moon is a Trademark &#8482; for the web
browser and the usage rights of the name and logo are reserved by the
owner.<br>
All graphics related to it are author-rights
protected, meaning as a general rule you are not allowed to use it
without permission. However, to allow people to promote the browser and
brand, these ownership rights are usually not enforced when used to
refer to Pale Moon on other sites and locations.<br>
      <br>
This means that for clarity, this page attempts to explain where the
line is drawn, insofar as common sense would not already dictate.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>DOs and DON'Ts</h3>
Perhaps the simplest way to set the general usage guidelines for the
branding and logo is by listing a few things you can do and a few
things you cannot do. These are examples and by no means definitive or
all-inclusive. If you have any doubts about the use of the logo or
branding/name in a certain context, please do get in touch to discuss
potential usage <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span> it is published, thanks.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DOs: You <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">are allowed</span> to:</span><br>

refers directly to the browser. This includes use on software portals,
etc.</li>
        <li>Use the Pale Moon name and logo to promote the browser on your own web properties, as long as you:<br>
- Make clear you are not an official agent of Pale Moon, <span style="font-weight: bold;">or</span><br>
- Only promote Pale Moon when following the guidelines below, <span style="font-weight: bold;">or</span><br>
- Discuss the promotion with me and are given permission to promote in a different way.</li>
        <li>Redistribute the officially-branded browser as long as you adhere to the <a href="/redist.shtml">redistribution license.</a></li>
        <li>Redistribute your own build of the browser that does not
carry the official name and logo (unofficial branding is included in
the source for you to use freely).</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DON'Ts: You <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">are not allowed</span> to:</span><br>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>Promotional use of the Pale Moon name and/or logo</h3>
As outlined above, you are allowed to use the Pale Moon&#8482; brand name and/or logo for promotional purposes for the browser.<br>
<br>
Guidelines for use:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Preferred use of
the logo is as a whole (round) logo, with optionally the wordmark
("Pale Moon") to the right of it (as on the website) or in smaller
font, width-matched, immediately below it (as in about:logo).</li>
        <li>The logo should be displayed in its full color depth and original colors.<br>
        </li>

        <li>Alternative use is the top 1/3 to 1/2 of the logo as design permits or desires.</li>
        <li>The
wordmark should be displayed in the chosen font (Museo, preferably
Museo 500) and with one of the two preferred colors (#17109E or
#244C8A) although small variations are permitted to cater to your page
design. Museo 500 is a freely available web font (no-cost license).</li>
        <li>The name is "Pale Moon", not "Palemoon", "PaleMoon",
"Pale-moon", "pale moon" or "palemoon". Please use the proper, 2-word,
capitalized form.</li>
        <li>Using
custom promotional slogans or catch phrases in relation
to the browser without clearing those with the owner first is strongly
discouraged, to prevent
potentially undesired impressions to the public. If you wish to use a
custom slogan/catch phrase in relation to the browser, that has not
been officially published before, then please get in touch with the
owner before publication to discuss.</li>
        <li>In general, it is not customary or required to include the Trademark &#8482; symbol when mentioning Pale Moon. For official documents it is, however, encouraged.<br>
        </li>
