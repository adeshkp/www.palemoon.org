              <a name="features" id="features"></a>Features/disabled features
            </h3>This browser aims to strike a balance between features and speed. As such, a choice has been made to
            consciously disable a few features found in other browsers that are not commonly used by the largest group
            of users. If you require any of the disabled features, then the main-line build of Pale Moon is not for
            you! You may find a suitable version on the third party <a href="contributed-builds.shtml">contributed
            builds</a> page instead.<br>
            <br>
            The Pale Moon browser has, among other things, the following features:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Specifically optimized for current processors.This browser will not run on particularly old systems.
              </li>
              <li>Increased stability: experience fewer crashes.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and Canvas.
              </li>
              <li>Support for many Firefox Extensions (add-ons) as a compatibility feature.
              </li>
              <li>Support for a growing number of Pale Moon specific Extensions.</li>
        <li>Offering low-level API access to extension developers to truly extend browser features.<br>
        </li>

              <li>Support for Personas ("lightweight" themes).
              </li>
              <li>Support for Complete Themes.<br>
              </li>
              <li>CSS Downloadable Font support (including WOFF and WOFF2).
              </li>
              <li>Extended HTML5, CSS3 and advanced DOM support.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Speedy scripting and page rendering.
              </li>
              <li>Optimized, secure networking.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Graphical tab switching with quick-search (user-selectable).<br>
              </li>
              <li>More customization options for navigation controls and the tab strip than other modern browsers.
              </li>
              <li>Enhanced security indicators (padlock/styling).
              </li>
              <li>More options for recovery (safe mode dialog).<br>
              </li>
            </ul>The following features have been <span class="c2">disabled or removed</span> by design:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Accessibility features</span>. Most people don't have a need for specialized
                accessibility features for custom input or display devices. This cuts down on the input complexity, and
                increases speed, but will, obviously, not be suitable for people who need these features.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Parental controls</span>. Pale Moon aims to be a fast browser for general use, not a
                "secured family browser". The design impact of operating system integrated parental controls as
                introduced in Mozilla code is significant, and has had serious implications for building the browser. As
                such, parental controls have been disabled. Extensions-based parental controls are, of course, a
                just-as viable alternative (and may in many cases work better!).<br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">WebRTC</span>. Apart from opening up a whole can of worms security/privacy-wise, "Web
                Real Time Chat" (comparable with Skype video calls and the likes) is not considered useful or desired
                functionality for Pale Moon (both according to the developers and the users of the browser at large).
                This is best left to dedicated programs or at most a browser plug-in.<br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Maintenance service</span>. Pale Moon does not use a Windows maintenance service and
                does not update silently in the background.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Integrated PDF reader</span>. You are
                always recommended to use a separate, up-to-date document reader for PDF files (as an external program,
                not as a browser plugin) for your own security, and to have documents displayed in their fully intended
                format instead of a stripped-down display in an in-browser reader.
              </li>
              
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Tab Groups</span>. The Tab Group (aka Panorama) feature has never properly matured and
                has not seen many people using it. In addition, the feature is generally slow to use, not intuitive,
                and puts a rather hefty load on the browser when included. For people who still prefer to use this
                feature even though it has been completely removed from the browser, an <a href="tabgroups.shtml">add-on is available</a> to replace the removed code.<br>
              </li>
              <li>A few miscellaneous things like the crashreporter and telemetry data gathering have been completely
              removed since they require server-side components that are not in place at palemoon.org, as well as the
              latter severely impacting user privacy.<br>
              </li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3>
              <a name="CPUsupport" id="CPUsupport"></a>Supported processors
            </h3>The Pale Moon browser is specifically optimized for current-day processors and uses instructions
            exclusively available in more modern (or rather: <span style="font-weight: bold;">not museum-grade</span>) processors. This means it will not run
            on PCs that are particularly old by today's standards, and is likely to display errors or refuse to start
            on systems with unsupported or poorly supported CPUs.<br>
            Requirements for the regular Pale Moon browser are, in short: <span class="c2">a CPU with SSE2 support</span>.<br>
            Since many people will not know off-hand what their CPU is capable of or what generation it is, here is a
            run-down of a number of popular CPUs around the time of inclusion of this instruction set, and if they are
            supported. In case of doubt if your CPU is supported or not, please find a CPU information tool like CPU-z
            or Crystal CPU-ID to check your CPU's capacities.<br>

processor around the era where this may be a question:<br>

            <h3>
              <a name="Firefox_Differences" id="Firefox_Differences"></a>How different is this browser from Mozilla products?
            </h3><span class="c11">The differences are increasingly significant as time passes. Pale Moon will remain
            close to Firefox in certain parts of the code to offer a degree of compatibility with add-ons, but
            should be considered a "fork" and a totally independent product.</span><span class="c12"></span><br>
            <ol>
              <li>Pale
Moon is based on a derivative of the Gecko rendering engine (Goanna).
This means that the core rendering functions for Pale Moon and Firefox
(and rebuilds) will be a relatively close match and that functionality
in the Gecko core code, will, as a ballpark estimate, also exist in
Pale Moon. Where specific core functions have been changed, it has been
done carefully and with due consideration to provide better performance
and efficiency while not endangering the security of the browser, and
to focus on better standards compatibility and/or more sane behavior. </li><li>Pale
Moon comes with a number of different default configuration settings
than Firefox and may behave differently when certain advanced configuration preferences are changed.<br>
Note
that "internet
speed boosters" and general "tweak guides" written for Firefox can
actually <span class="c12">harm</span> Pale Moon's speed as the configuration defaults are made with
              in-depth knowledge of the browser back-end and "a higher number" or "bigger buffer" isn't always better.
              <span class="c12">You are strongly advised to always use defaults as supplied in Pale Moon.</span>
              </li>
              <li>Changes were made to the user interface and feature set, to incorporate functionality and visual
              elements in <a href="layout-differences.shtml">different locations</a> than what was chosen by the
              Mozilla team, as well as <span class="c2">retaining or re-introducing useful elements that were removed
              in Firefox</span>, and either removing or disabling (by default) components that would not be used by the
              average user. In addition, some other user interface changes were made to provide an as consistent and
              intuitive interface as possible while still staying close to what Firefox's goals have always been.
              <span class="c2">This means the "Australis" interface will never be used in Pale Moon.</span><br>
              </li>
              <li>Pale Moon offers more configurability for features, like additional tab preferences, preferences for
              image loading or tab positions, and full control over smooth scrolling, to name a few.
              </li>
              <li>Pale Moon uses a different "Sync" client and its own server to synchronize data between different
              instances of the browser. This is not compatible with Firefox Sync as used in Firefox 29 or later.
              Mozilla's change to "Firefox Accounts" is a different and less secure approach to synchronizing data and
              focuses more on future commercial endeavours of the Mozilla Corporation and, after careful consideration,
              has been rejected for use in Pale Moon (for quite the list of reasons, to be fair).<br>

              <li>Optimizations:
SSE2 architecture, global speed-preference flags, intrinsic functions
where possible, auto-vectorization, auto-parallelization. Some small
variations of these could be possible depending on specific release
builds. Many of the builds (and all recent ones) use identical-code
folding to further increase speed and reduce size of the program at the
expense of compile time. </li>
