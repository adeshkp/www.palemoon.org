              <a name="features" id="features"></a>Features/disabled features
            </h3>This browser aims to strike a balance between features and speed. As such, a choice has been made to
            consciously disable a few features found in other browsers that are not commonly used by the largest group
            of users. If you require any of the disabled features, then the main-line build of Pale Moon is not for
            you! You may find a suitable version on the third party <a href="contributed-builds.shtml">contributed
            builds</a> page instead.<br>
            <br>
            The Pale Moon browser has, among other things, the following features:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Specifically optimized for current processors. It makes use of the enhanced instruction sets of newer
              CPUs - as a result, this browser will not run on particularly old systems.
              </li>
              <li>Increased stability: experience fewer crashes.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and Canvas.
              </li>
              <li>Support for many Firefox Extensions (add-ons).
              </li>
              <li>Support for Pale Moon specific Extensions.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Support for Personas ("lightweight" themes).
              </li>
              <li>Support for Complete Themes.<br>
              </li>
              <li>CSS Downloadable Font support (including WOFF).
              </li>
              <li>Extended HTML5, CSS3 and advanced DOM support.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Speedy scripting and page rendering.
              </li>
              <li>Optimized, secure networking.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Graphical tab switching with quick-search (user-selectable).<br>
              </li>
              <li>More customization options for navigation controls and the tab strip.
              </li>
              <li>Enhanced security indicators (padlock/styling).
              </li>
              <li>More options for recovery (safe mode dialog).<br>
              </li>
            </ul>The following features have been <span class="c2">disabled or removed</span> by design:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Accessibility features</span>. Most people don't have a need for specialized
                accessibility features for custom input or display devices. This cuts down on the input complexity, and
                increases speed, but will, obviously, not be suitable for people who need these features.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Parental controls</span>. Pale Moon aims to be a fast browser for general use, not a
                "secured family browser". The design impact of operating system integrated parental controls as
                introduced in Mozilla code is significant, and has had serious implications for building the browser. As
                such, parental controls have been disabled. Extensions-based parental controls are, of course, a
                just-as viable alternative (and may in many cases work better!).<br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">WebRTC</span>. Apart from opening up a whole can of worms security/privacy-wise, "Web
                Real Time Chat" (comparable with Skype video calls and the likes) is not considered useful or desired
                functionality for Pale Moon (both according to the developers and the users of the browser at large).
                This is best left to dedicated programs or at most a browser plug-in.<br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Maintenance service</span>. Pale Moon does not use a Windows maintenance service and
                does not update silently in the background.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Integrated PDF reader</span>. The code for this is still included for emergencies
                (i.e. when you need to read a PDF but don't have access to a reader) but disabled by default - you are
                always recommended to use a separate, up-to-date document reader for PDF files (as an external program,
                not as a browser plugin) for your own security, and to have documents displayed in their fully intended
                format instead of a stripped-down display in an in-browser reader.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Social API</span>. We do not integrate at the browser core level with social media.<br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Tab Groups</span>. The Tab Group (aka Panorama) feature has never properly matured and
                has not seen many people using it. In addition, the feature is generally slow to use, not intuitive,
                and puts a rather hefty load on the browser when included. For people who still prefer to use this
                feature even though it has been completely removed from the browser, an <a href="tabgroups.shtml">add-on is available</a> to replace the removed code.<br>
              </li>
              <li>A few miscellaneous things like the crashreporter and telemetry data gathering have been completely
              removed since they require server-side components that are not in place at palemoon.org, as well as the
              latter severely impacting user privacy.<br>
              </li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3>
              <a name="CPUsupport" id="CPUsupport"></a>Supported processors
            </h3>The Pale Moon browser is specifically optimized for current-day processors and uses instructions
            exclusively available in more modern (or rather: not museum-grade) processors. This means it will not run
            on PCs that are particularly old by today's standards, and is likely to display errors or refuse to start
            on systems with unsupported or poorly supported CPUs.<br>
            Requirements for the regular Pale Moon browser are, in short: <span class="c2">a 7th or later generation
            CPU with SSE2 support</span>.<br>
            Since many people will not know off-hand what their CPU is capable of or what generation it is, here is a
            run-down of a number of popular CPUs around the time of includion of this instruction set, and if they are
            supported. In case of doubt if your CPU is supported or not, please find a CPU information tool like CPU-z
            or Crystal CPU-ID to check your CPU's capacities.<br>

            <h3>
              <a name="Firefox_Differences" id="Firefox_Differences"></a>How different is this browser from Mozilla products?
            </h3><span class="c11">The differences are increasingly significant as time passes. Pale Moon will remain
            close to Firefox in certain parts of the code to ensure compatibility with many add-ons, but
            should be considered a "fork" and a totally independent product.</span><span class="c12"></span><br>
            <ol>
              <li>Pale
Moon is based on a derivative of the Gecko rendering engine (Goanna).
This means that the core rendering functions for Pale Moon and Firefox
(and rebuilds) will be a relatively close match and that functionality
in the Gecko core code, will, as a ballpark estimate, also exist in
Pale Moon. Where specific core functions have been changed, it has been
done carefully and with due consideration to provide better performance
and efficiency while not endangering the security of the browser, and
to focus on better standards compatibility and/or more sane behavior. </li><li>Pale
Moon comes with a number of different default configuration settings
than Firefox. These basic "tweaks" (I'd prefer to call them "more sane
defaults") are done with in-depth knowledge of the modified engine, to
provide you with the smoothest browsing experience as well as to be
considerate towards the Internet ecosystem, website/service providers
and residential gateways (e.g. by reducing the number of concurrent
http and total dns requests needed when browsing) without relying on
protocol extensions that are often not or not properly supported. Note
that "internet
speed boosters" and general "tweak guides" written for Firefox can
actually <span class="c12">harm</span> Pale Moon's speed as the configuration defaults are made with
              in-depth knowledge of the browser back-end and "a higher number" or "bigger buffer" isn't always better.
              <span class="c12">You are strongly advised to always use defaults as supplied in Pale Moon.</span>
              </li>
              <li>Changes were made to the user interface and feature set, to incorporate functionality and visual
              elements in <a href="layout-differences.shtml">different locations</a> than what was chosen by the
              Mozilla team, as well as <span class="c2">retaining or re-introducing useful elements that were removed
              in Firefox</span>, and either removing or disabling (by default) components that would not be used by the
              average user. In addition, some other user interface changes were made to provide an as consistent and
              intuitive interface as possible while still staying close to what Firefox's goals have always been.
              <span class="c2">This means the "Australis" interface will never be used in Pale Moon.</span><br>
              </li>
              <li>Pale Moon offers more configurability for features, like additional tab preferences, preferences for
              image loading or tab positions, and full control over smooth scrolling, to name a few.
              </li>
              <li>Pale Moon uses a different "Sync" client and its own server to synchronize data between different
              instances of the browser. This is not compatible with Firefox Sync as used in Firefox 29 or later.
              Mozilla's change to "Firefox Accounts" is a different and less secure approach to synchronizing data and
              focuses more on future commercial endeavours of the Mozilla Corporation and, after careful consideration,
              has been rejected for use in Pale Moon (for quite the list of reasons, to be fair).<br>
              </li>
              <li>A stock Firefox executable is built to run on, by today's standards, <span class="c13">ancient</span>
              hardware (are you still running a first generation Pentium processor? I wouldn't think so). The build
              environment used for Pale Moon allows for specific optimizations in the building process that actually
              <span class="c13">uses</span> the capabilities of the computer hardware it runs on (specifically:
              advanced processing instructions) and gears the machine code at the assembly level specifically towards
              certain generations of processors, as opposed to trying to compromise for different ways of working of
              old (read: museum-grade) hardware. This impacts <span class="c13">every</span> aspect of the browser,
              from loading pages to drawing graphics and running scripts.</li>

            </h3>Pale Moon builds are tested for stability before being released by having it used for day-to-day
            browsing by a group of beta testers. This includes but is not limited to:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Graphics heavy art sites
              </li>
              <li>Static HTML sites with many elements
              </li>
              <li>DHTML/CSS sites
              </li>
              <li>SSL/heavy authentication sites
              </li>
              <li>Flash-heavy sites

            <li>Software: Windows 7 64-bit, Windows 8 SDK, DX9/10 SDK<br>
                  </li>

                  
            <li>Compiler: MS Visual Studio 2012 Update 5 (MSVC CL 11)
                  </li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Optimizations: SSE2 architecture, global speed-preference flags, intrinsic functions where possible,
              auto-vectorization, auto-parallelization. Some small variations of these could be possible depending on
              specific release builds. Whole Program Optimization is used to provide the most efficiently linked
              binaries. Many of the builds (and all recent ones) use identical COMDAT folding to further increase speed
              and reduce size of the program at the expense of compile time.
              </li>
              <li>Profile Guided Optimization was used between 3.6.0.1 and 15.4.1 - even though this relies very
              heavily on the machine the browser is <span class="c13">compiled</span> on - which would generally
              <span class="c13">not</span> be a good measure for a browser that is used over a wide array of different
              systems - the overall performance increase when using a manually, carefully selected set of operations
              for application profiling resulted in a significant increase in performance in those versions. With the
              change to Visual Studio 2012, PGO became (a lot) less significant and starting with Pale Moon 19.0, a
              more general code optimization was used to make the resulting program perform equally well regardless of
              O.S. and PC used on, and more importantly, improve stability of the browser by avoiding compiler/linker
              bugs related to PGO.<br>
