      <h1>Pale Moon Contact</h1>
We no longer offer direct contact with our developers due to
required focus being drawn away from development to handle support
requests despite the clear indicators of self-help resources and
requests to use the normal channels to get technical support for Pale
Moon. In addition, the increased amount of abuse initiated through web
feedback forms would require a disproportionate amount of data
verification going forward, which would benefit neither the developer
nor you.<br>
      <br>
You are kindly requested to direct all your feedback and communication
to the
community-supported Pale Moon forum:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><a
 href="https://forum.palemoon.org/"><big><big>https://forum.palemoon.org/</big></big></a><br>
      </div>
      <br>
Please post in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">public</span>
boards for any <span style="font-weight: bold;">technical support
questions or general feedback</span>, taking care to use the board that
best matches your type of question or feedback.<br>
      <br>
This is also the designated initial contact channel for any other
parties, i.e. for business inquiries or press contact (you may use
private messages on the forum for that if necessary). We apologize for
any inconvenience but it is necessary as a result of constant scraping
of websites as e-mail targets for spam. "This is why we can't have nice
things."<br>
      <br>
If you are an IRC user, you can also get in touch with some members of
our community in chat by going to #palemoon on the Freenode network.<br>
