      <h1>Pale Moon Live Chat etiquette<br>
      </h1>

Pale Moon has an IRC channel that is operated on the Freenode IRC
network (a chat network mainly focusing on Free and Open Source
Software). While on the chat network and in the chat room, you are
requested to adhere to the following etiquette rules. Not following these rules can
get you removed from the chatroom (temporarily or permanently,
depending on behavior):<br>

      <br>

      <ul>
<li>The chatroom is meant for users of an adult mindset. Please only
use the chatroom if you are of adult age or have the mental capacity
equivalent of an adult.</li>
        <li>Please mind your language. The chatroom is a public room, and
offending people with excessive use of course language is frowned upon.
Although everyone is assumed to be of adult age (see previous point),
and you may be upset about something, you're kindly requested to keep
your use of language under control.</li>
        <li>Please
keep in mind that the chatroom will be used by
people from all walks of life, and all levels of computer skill. It is
meant to be a place to offer help, and if you cannot do so, or a
problem is too complex, or you find that it is too difficult to
translate a solution into something that can be easily understood in
chat and/or by the person asking the question, then please forward them
in a kind manner to the Pale Moon forum. Talking down on people because
they are not "power users" will be grounds for immediate removal from
the channel.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Please
do not use ALL CAPS when chatting. Please try to use understandable
spelling and please use punctuation. Making yourself clearly understood
is in everyone's interest :)</li>
        <li>Please use English at all times. Languages other than
English should be taken to private chat or other channels specifically
catering to the non-English language spoken.<br>
        </li>

        <li>Please do not try to unnecessarily mask your identity. We are all people there, with personalities and identities.
It is much easier to relate to and assist someone that actually tries
to approach others with a personal identity than someone who goes at
length to mask themselves. None of the topics in the chatroom will be
personally or ideologically sensitive if we can help it, so there will
be no need to hide/cloak/mask yourself.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Please do not start flame wars or personal attacks against other users visiting the channel.</li>
        <li>Please do not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29" target="_blank">troll</a> or be disruptive to the chat. <br>
</li>
        <li>Please do not start discussions about politics, religion,
or other touchy subjects that are not necessarily related to the
browser (off-topic) and can easily lead to an very unwelcome
atmosphere. Although enforcing of this point will be done leniently,
you are asked to apply common sense and stop a particular line of
conversation if it gets too heated or opinionated for the channel's
overall atmosphere. If you want to continue an off-topic or in-depth discussion with someone, please take it to private chat!<br>
        </li>

      </ul>
