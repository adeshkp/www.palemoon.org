              History of the Pale Moon project<br>
            </h1>This project started off as merely fiddling with the build process on Windows, seeing first off if I
            could manage to make my own Windows build of the Firefox browser and then seeing how my own builds compared
            to official ones. Finding the difference significant, the resulting browsers (simply "my own Firefox
            builds") were given to a number of friends to use, with very positive results.<br>
            This was back in the time when Firefox was still in its 1.5.x stage.<br>
            <br>
            I have since built Firefox, Thunderbird and Seamonkey specifically for different systems, gaining
            experience, learning the quirks and following code development. Eventually, with Firefox 3.5.2, I settled
            on what I found was an optimal compromise between speed, features and useability of the browser. At that
            point in time, the Pale Moon project was given shape, releasing the highly optimized browser to the public
            from Oct 4th, 2009.<br>
            <br>
            Since its release, it has become rather popular, with no less than 15,000 visits to the home page just in
            the first month of release. With many downloads from a wide range of locations, not all of them monitored
            or counted, it is anyone's guess how many people are actually using it, but it has surpassed anything that
            was initially expected.<br>
            <br>
            Feedback has been positive, and as a result of several requests from people, a second build version was
            created of Pale Moon, to cater specifically to the capabilities of Athlon XP and Athlon MP processors,
            still extremely popular processors for systems used at the time. Later on, a portable version was also
            created to allow people to take Pale Moon with them on USB stick or removable drives.<br>
            <br>
            As the source code developed, so did Pale Moon, and a few major changes have been made with the transition
            from 3.5 to 3.6 versions and later on to separate Pale Moon installations from Firefox ones. Always
            attempting to strike a balance, some minor features were removed, and later added again; feedback from the
            users has always been taken into account, and the development of Pale Moon has therefore been given shape,
            in part, by its users.<br>
            <br>
            When version 4.0 of the Firefox code arrived, after extensive betas, Pale Moon deviated further from its
            sibling by also making changes to the standard UI (User Interface) layout. UI design choices made to
            "innovate" the user interface, removing quite essential user feedback and changing the layout of navigation
            controls were considered to be poor choices, and have been altered to provide a more familiar, and also
            more intuitive, interface to the browser.<br>
            At this point it was also decided to keep developing the 3.6.x branch separately, while version 4 and later
            became the "next generation" branch.<br>
            <br>
            An accelerated major version release scheme was started on in early 2011, with ambitious plans by Mozilla
            to make faster changes to Firefox. When version 5.0 arrived, though, it turned out to be a release that
            could just as well have been numbered 4.1 or similar, as there was surprisingly little that had changed,
            apart from correcting some mistakes made in the implementation of 4.0. 5.0 can therefore best be considered
            a "bugfix release" of 4.0, and not really a new product.<br>
            Version 6.0 saw a similarly small amount of changes and both 5.0 and 6.0 have been considered to be a
            continuation of the "next generation" branch of the Firefox product started with version 4.0. As such, 4.0
            and 5.0 were discontinued for Pale Moon. This trend was continued for later versions.<br>
            <br>
            In Oct 2011, a new milestone was reached with Pale Moon 7: better resource use, faster code, and maturation
            of the code base to a level where 3.x now became depreciated in favor of this version - still, the old
            branch continued to be supported and developed because there was still a clear need for it, and remained
            the browser of choice for "special needs" environments.<br>
            <br>
            From this point on, development on the Next Generation (versions 4 and up) branch continued, following
            Mozilla Firefox for most major releases, while the 3.6.x (Legacy) branch continued to see patches for
            bugfixes, security issues and some performance improvements, including continued support beyond Mozilla's
            EoL (End of Life) date for the 3.x branch. Inevitably, though, the older engine started falling terribly
            short of its intended purpose, and as more and more sites became problematic, the legacy branch was
            discontinued in the summer of 2012.<br>
            <br>
            April 2012 saw another milestone with the release of version 12, at which point the release schedule
            stopped following Mozilla's rapid release schedule of Firefox. From this point on, development and release
            of Pale Moon became fully independent and more specifically aimed at refining the engine and features and
            implementing additional, Pale Moon specific features. Pale Moon diverged from its sibling with each release
            into a separate, independent browser not longer necessarily tied to Firefox code development or release,
            although a close parallel was maintained for extension compatibility by rebasing Pale Moon code on top of
            later Firefox versions.<br>
            <br>
            With the release of Firefox 24 (and Pale Moon of the same version), Pale Moon's already divergent
            development direction started to more clearly separate from Firefox than it had already done before, by
            focusing much more strongly on individual development of interface, features and back-end, while adopting
            continued security updates through Firefox's ESR channel. After a year of this development (and turbulent
            times for Firefox with the growing dislike for the decisions made about the browser by their development
            and management teams), the decision was made for Pale Moon to completely and decisively break the existing
            direct ties with Firefox (in the form of how it identifies itself) and be a completely independent force on
            the browser market.<br>
            <br>
            This is where we are now, with Pale Moon 25 and later: a fully independent browser product.<br>
            <br>
            <h2>
              Future directions
            </h2>The outline Mozilla has sketched seems to be to make Firefox more than a browser, and to spread thin
            across different disciplines and platforms in an attempt to make a web-OS, Skype client alternative, App
            developer environment, mobile phone OS or swiss army knife out of it, as well as increasing ties with
            on-line commercial ventures like Google, Yahoo, social media sites, and whomever wishes to pay to be
            advertised in the browser. These plans may look nice on paper, but would most likely see a vast amount of
            practical issues when trying to implement them, as has already been shown in decreasing stability and
            usability in the Firefox browser in recent times.<br>
            <br>
            In addition, Mozilla touting minor bugfix releases of Firefox as "major" releases (for the inherent buzz as
            many review sites feel compelled to write an article with each major version release) and constant changes
            in the browser (best left to beta channels) being forced upon everyone has clearly led to "user fatigue"
            and even more so "(extension) developer fatigue" where both users and developers get tired of constantly
            having to change their way of working and coding, respectively, with each rapid release.<br>
            <br>
            Pale Moon aims, instead, to follow standards developments and adapt to the changes on the Web, without
            losing track of what it is supposed to be: a web browser.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>
              Australis
            </h3>Pale Moon will continue to use the well-known, fully customizable user interface, and will not be
            following Mozilla's (and alternative rebuilds') move to the "Australis" user interface (by a number of
            people dubbed "FireChrome" because of its likeness with Google's Chrome browser interface) introduced in
            Firefox 29.<br>
            Instead, the current plan for Pale Moon is to stick to a stable, solid, and easily maintainable base code
            that started off initially as Firefox 24 ESR (with a number of reverted changes to keep maximum
            configurability as well as important updates ported back from later Firefox versions) and to maintain and
            develop this code further.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>
              Bottom line
            </h3><span class="bold">Pale Moon aims to remain what it is at its heart: a fully customizable web
            browser.</span><br>
            "Added tools" are nice, but may not be adopted in Pale Moon if they go beyond what should normally be part
            of a web browser for general use.<br>
