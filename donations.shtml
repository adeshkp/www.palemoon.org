      <h2><a name="Monetary_donations"></a>
              Monetary donations
            </h2>
You can transfer money by using one of the following methods:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Paypal - this is a well-known US-based electronic money provider. You can use the donation button on
              the <a href="http://www.palemoon.org/">Pale Moon home page</a> to make a donation through PayPal.<br>
              </li>
              
        

              <li>Bank (wire) transfer<br>
                For people living in the EU, this is an option as well (sorry, I don't accept wire transfers from
                outside the EU zone due to fees) as long as your bank offers SEPA transfers. Contact me to get the bank
                details.
              </li>
              <li>Bitcoin: You can donate any amount you wish to Moonchild Productions' wallet:<br>
                <div class="center">
                  <span class="bold">1PaLEmooNYSouqxNZU2U4zHaSRfPBH6ifE</span><br>
                </div>Please note that Bitcoin is anonymous by nature and you will not be listed by name on this
                page.<br>
              </li>
              
              <li>Other
cryptocurrencies are no longer directly accepted at this time. It is
too
cumbersome to deal with the many different types of cryptocurrencies
for one-time donations that are likely never going to see more
occurrences in the same coin, as well as the unreliable nature of
cryptocurrency exchanges. You can, however, use the "altcoin" button on
the home page to have alternative cryptocurrency automatically
converted and donated.<br>

                </li>
              <li>Sending cash (bills only please, no coins)<br>
                If you prefer, you can also send a donation in the form of cash (any currency accepted, but Swedish
                Crowns preferred. Sending money in an envelope is always at your own risk; please make sure to not make
                it obvious as it may get stolen by postal workers in that case.<br>

              Donating development hardware
            </h2>If you wish to donate (surplus) hardware to help development of Pale Moon, you should contact me by
            e-mail at moonchild [at] palemoon.org to discuss if what you wish to donate will be useful for me (saves
            unnecessary shipping expenses and saves stuff taking up my floor space ;) ).<br>
      <br>
<h2><a name="Donating_services"></a>
              Donating services
            </h2>If you want to supply services to help Pale Moon development, there are a few possible areas you may
            be able to help. Please contact me to discuss this.<br>
            <br>
            Potential service areas:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Advertising! Spread the word, launch an ad campaign, tell your friends, hand out flyers, etc.<br>
              </li>
              <li>File mirrors (burst capable, direct-link capable, zero-ads) (any location except DE)<br>
              </li>
              
              <li>Any other service you think may be of benefit to Pale Moon development</li>
            </ul><br>
      <h2><a name="Corporate_sponsorship"></a>Corporate sponsorship</h2>
If you are an established company and wish to become a corporate
sponsor of the Pale Moon project, then that is also an option. Please
note that this kind of sponsorship involves a significant contribution
in terms of resources or financial support. If you are simply looking
for a prominent placement of your logo to improve your back-links or
SEO then kindly please move right along. This is not purchasable
advertisement space, and your sponsorship support is expected to be
significantly greater than the average advertising costs involved for
custom ads. Currently, corporate sponsorship packages have a minimum of
$50/month threshold, with a normal expected amount of twice that.
Please consider regular and/or recurring donations for support amounts
smaller than that which will still have your support listed on this
page.<br>
      <br>
Corporate sponsorship will give your company a prominent mention on the
project home page for as long as the endorsement lasts, with a display
of your logo and link back to your company's site.<br>
      <br>
To be eligible for a sponsorship position:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Your company must be an established company, not an
individual. We currently don't accept personal home pages or individual
sponsorship - please use other forms of donation if you wish to help
out as an individual.</li>
        <li>Your company must have clear (and preferably public) support of Open Source software and support the principles behind it.</li>
        <li>You must be a direct representative of the company. We
can't accept third-party endorsements for a number of legal and
practical reasons.</li>
        <li>Sponsorship must be of an on-going nature. Although we
don't expect indefinite support, we do expect you to dedicate at least
a year of endorsement to our project.</li>
        <li>You should have a logo available for us to use of
sufficient clarity. Transparent backgrounds surrounding logos are
greatly preferred.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
Please contact business-inquiries [at] palemoon [dot] org if you wish to apply to become our sponsor.<br>
