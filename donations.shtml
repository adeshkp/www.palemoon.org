      </ul>
      <h2><a name="Donating_development_hardware"></a> Donating
development hardware </h2>
If you wish to donate (surplus) hardware to help development of Pale
Moon, you should contact me by e-mail at moonchild [at] palemoon.org to
discuss if what you wish to donate will be useful for me (saves
unnecessary shipping expenses and saves stuff taking up my floor space
;) ).<br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="Donating_services"></a> Donating services </h2>
If you want to supply services to help Pale Moon development, there are
a few possible areas you may be able to help. Please contact me to
discuss this.<br>
      <br>
Potential service areas:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Evangelism! Spread the word, launch an ad campaign, tell
your friends, hand out flyers, etc.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Any other service you think may be of benefit to Pale Moon
development</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="Corporate_sponsorship"></a>Corporate sponsorship</h2>
If you are an established company and wish to become a corporate
sponsor of the Pale Moon project, then that is also an option. Please
note that this kind of sponsorship involves a significant contribution
in terms of resources or financial support. If you are simply looking
for a prominent placement of your logo to improve your back-links or
SEO then kindly please move right along. This is not purchasable
advertisement space, and your sponsorship support is expected to be
significantly greater than the average advertising costs involved for
custom ads. Currently, corporate sponsorship packages have a minimum of
$100/month threshold; Open Source sponsors can get an OSS package with
a lower minimum of $50/month.
Please consider regular and/or recurring donations for support amounts
smaller than that using the services above.<br>
      <br>
Corporate sponsorship will give your company a prominent mention on the
project home page for as long as the endorsement lasts, with a display
of your logo and link back to your company's site.<br>
      <br>
To be eligible for a sponsorship position:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Your company must be an established company, not an
individual. We currently don't accept personal home pages or individual
sponsorship - please use other forms of donation if you wish to help
out as an individual.</li>
        <li>Your company must have clear (and preferably public)
support of Open Source software and support the principles behind it to
be eligible for the OSS package.</li>
        <li>You must be a direct representative of the company. We
can't accept third-party endorsements for a number of legal and
practical reasons.</li>
        <li>Sponsorship must be of an on-going nature. Although we
don't expect indefinite support, we do expect you to dedicate at least
a year of endorsement to our project.</li>
        <li>You should have a logo available for us to use of
sufficient clarity. Transparent backgrounds surrounding logos are
greatly preferred.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
Please contact business-inquiries [at] palemoon [dot] org if you wish
to apply to become our sponsor.<br>
      <br>
      <h1><a name="Thank_you"></a> Thank you </h1>
I would like to express my thanks to all the people who, over the
years, have supported our project in one way or another. <br>
