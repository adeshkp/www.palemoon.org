      <h1> Pale Moon Donations and Support </h1>
If you enjoy this free browser enough to want to give something in
return, there are several ways you can support development of Pale
Moon. <span class="red bold">If you want your donation to remain
anonymous, please make sure to let me know</span><span

      <h2><a name="Monetary_donations"></a> Monetary donations </h2>
You can transfer money by using one of the following methods:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Paypal - this is a well-known US-based electronic money
provider. You can use the donation button on the <a
 href="http://www.palemoon.org/">Pale Moon home page</a> to make a
donation through PayPal. Please note that due to transfer fees
involved, we ask that you donate at least $5 (USD) or the equivalent
when using PayPal. For smaller amounts, consider e.g. Bitcoin<br>
        </li>
        <li>Bank (wire) transfer<br>
For people living in the EU, this is an option as well (sorry, I don't
accept wire transfers from outside the EU zone due to fees) as long as
your bank offers SEPA transfers. Contact me to get the bank details. </li>
        <li>Bitcoin: You can donate any amount you wish to Moonchild
Productions' wallet:<br>
          <div class="center"> <span class="bold">1PaLEmooNYSouqxNZU2U4zHaSRfPBH6ifE</span><br>
          </div>
Please note that Bitcoin is anonymous by nature and you will not be
listed by name on this page.<br>
If you donate using Bitcoin, <span style="font-weight: bold;">please
make sure you pay the appropriate mining fee/KiB</span>, or your
donation may get stuck! For longer term health and improvement of the
Bitcoin network and lower fees, please consider using <a
 href="https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/" target="_blank">Bitcoin
Unlimited</a>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Other
cryptocurrencies are no longer directly accepted at this time. It is
too
cumbersome to deal with the many different types of cryptocurrencies
for one-time donations that are likely never going to see more
occurrences in the same coin, as well as the unreliable nature of
cryptocurrency exchanges. You can, however, use the "altcoin" button on
the home page to have alternative cryptocurrency automatically
converted and donated.<br>
See <a href="http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=4044">http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=4044</a><br>
        </li>
        <li>Sending cash (bills only please, no coins)<br>
If you prefer, you can also send a donation in the form of cash (any
currency accepted, but Swedish Crowns preferred. Sending money in an
envelope is always at your own risk; please make sure to not make it
obvious as it may get stolen by postal workers in that case.<br>

      <h2><a name="Donating_development_hardware"></a> Donating
development hardware </h2>
If you wish to donate (surplus) hardware to help development of Pale
Moon, you should contact me by e-mail at moonchild [at] palemoon.org to
discuss if what you wish to donate will be useful for me (saves
unnecessary shipping expenses and saves stuff taking up my floor space
;) ).<br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="Donating_services"></a> Donating services </h2>
If you want to supply services to help Pale Moon development, there are
a few possible areas you may be able to help. Please contact me to
discuss this.<br>
      <br>
Potential service areas:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Advertising! Spread the word, launch an ad campaign, tell
your friends, hand out flyers, etc.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Any other service you think may be of benefit to Pale Moon
development</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="Corporate_sponsorship"></a>Corporate sponsorship</h2>
If you are an established company and wish to become a corporate
sponsor of the Pale Moon project, then that is also an option. Please
note that this kind of sponsorship involves a significant contribution
in terms of resources or financial support. If you are simply looking
for a prominent placement of your logo to improve your back-links or
SEO then kindly please move right along. This is not purchasable
advertisement space, and your sponsorship support is expected to be
significantly greater than the average advertising costs involved for
custom ads. Currently, corporate sponsorship packages have a minimum of
$100/month threshold; Open Source sponsors can get an OSS package with
a lower minimum of $50/month.
Please consider regular and/or recurring donations for support amounts
smaller than that which will still have your support listed on this
page.<br>
      <br>
Corporate sponsorship will give your company a prominent mention on the
project home page for as long as the endorsement lasts, with a display
of your logo and link back to your company's site.<br>
      <br>
To be eligible for a sponsorship position:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Your company must be an established company, not an
individual. We currently don't accept personal home pages or individual
sponsorship - please use other forms of donation if you wish to help
out as an individual.</li>
        <li>Your company must have clear (and preferably public)
support of Open Source software and support the principles behind it to
be eligible for the OSS package.</li>
        <li>You must be a direct representative of the company. We
can't accept third-party endorsements for a number of legal and
practical reasons.</li>
        <li>Sponsorship must be of an on-going nature. Although we
don't expect indefinite support, we do expect you to dedicate at least
a year of endorsement to our project.</li>
        <li>You should have a logo available for us to use of
sufficient clarity. Transparent backgrounds surrounding logos are
greatly preferred.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
Please contact business-inquiries [at] palemoon [dot] org if you wish
to apply to become our sponsor.<br>
