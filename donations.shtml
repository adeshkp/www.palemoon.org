You can donate money by using one of the following methods:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Ko-Fi: For irregular donations, one-time support, or just
to toss us some change to get a coffee :) at <a

      <h2><a name="Donating_development_hardware"></a> Donating
development hardware </h2>
If you wish to donate (surplus) hardware to help development of Pale
Moon, you should contact me by e-mail at moonchild [at] palemoon.org to
discuss if what you wish to donate will be useful for me (saves
unnecessary shipping expenses and saves stuff taking up my floor space
;) ).<br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="Donating_services"></a> Donating services </h2>
If you want to supply services to help Pale Moon development, there are
a few possible areas you may be able to help. Please contact me to
discuss this.<br>
      <br>
Potential service areas:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Evangelism! Spread the word, launch an ad campaign, tell
your friends, hand out flyers, etc.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Any other service you think may be of benefit to Pale Moon
development or publication.</li>
        <li>Wikieditors and translators to update and maintain the
various pages on Wikipedia.</li>
        <li>Translation of the browser by joining our localization
team. See <a
 href="https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;t=19474">this
forum post</a> for details.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="Corporate_sponsorship"></a>Corporate sponsorship</h2>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thank you for your interest, but
this sponsorship option is no longer available.</span><br>
      <br>
With great thanks to our Patreon supporters, we are now in a position
to phase out structured corporate sponsorship of the project. We no
longer accept new applications for sponsorship as displayed on our
front page. Existing sponsors will be phased out over time as their
commitment period lapses.<br>
If you are an established company and wish to support the Pale Moon
project, then from this point forward you can provide this support
through our Patreon page (see above) just like individual patrons.<br>
      <br>
We do not accept "sponsored content" on any of our websites. We do not
accept "sponsored posts", "sponsored articles", nor do we have a blog
or other article feed where such posts have a place. Please do not
e-mail us asking for such sponsored articles to be placed anywhere on
our websites; the answer will invariably be "no" and your e-mail will
be considered unsolicited commercial e-mail (and treated as such when
persisted).<br>
      <br>
      <h1><a name="Thank_you"></a> Thank you </h1>
I would like to express my thanks to all the people who, over the
years, have supported our project in one way or another. <br>
      <br>

help, support and contributions, Pale Moon would not have been possible!</span><br>
