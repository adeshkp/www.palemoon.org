      <h2>Pale Moon Sync Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>This privacy policy explains to what extent Moonchild
Productions ("we", "us", etc.) collects and uses information about
users of Sync as found in the Pale Moon browser (&#8220;Pale Moon Sync
Service&#8221;), where such users use our maintained servers.</p>

        
      <h3>Definitions</h3>

        
      <p><strong>&#8220;Personal Information&#8221;</strong> is information that 
you provide to us that personally identifies you, such as your name, 
phone number, or email address. Except for your email address, we 
do not collect or require end-users of the Pale Moon Sync Service to furnish
 Personal Information. </p>

        
      <p><strong>&#8220;Non-Personal Information&#8221;</strong> is information 
that cannot by itself be directly associated with a specific person or 
entity. Non-Personal Information includes but is not limited to your 
computer&#8217;s configuration and the version of Sync you use.</p>
 
        
      <p><strong>&#8220;Potentially Personal Information&#8221;</strong> is 
information that is Non-Personal Information in and of itself but that 
could be used in conjunction with other information to personally 
identify you. For example, Uniform Resource Locators (&#8220;URLs&#8221;) (the 
addresses of web pages) and Internet Protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) addresses (the 
addresses of computers on the internet) can be Personal Information when
 combined with internet service provider (&#8220;ISP&#8221;) records.</p>
 
        
      <p><strong>&#8220;Operational Data&#8221;</strong> means aggregated data 
regarding users&#8217; usage of the Sync Service, such as access log 
data (such as data about when people access the service and with what 
piece of software), how many records of each type users were creating in
 aggregate (such as how many bookmarks, history, or tabs users have 
created and synced). We collect Operational Data to help us ensure that we have sufficient storage to meet user needs 
and otherwise to help with the operation of the Service.</p>
 
        
      <p><strong>&#8220;Usage Statistics&#8221;</strong> refers to the Non-Personal
Information we will use to understand your use of the Pale Moon Sync
Service. Such information may include but is not limited to the amount
of data you are storing with the service, the frequency with which you
access the service, and bandwidth utilization.</p>
 
        
      <p><strong>&#8220;User Data&#8221;</strong> is the digital content stored 
on, manipulated, and transmitted to and from our servers by means 
of your use of Pale Moon Sync. Examples of User Data include those items 
that you choose to synchronize across devices using Sync, such 
as your browsing history, form history, bookmarks, saved passwords, 
preferences, and open tabs. User Data does not include your username, 
email address, or password.</p>

        
      <h3>Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Transmitted Data</h3>

        
      <h4>Account Information</h4>

        
      <p>Before you are able to access the Pale Moon Sync Service, you will be 
required to register. To register, the Pale Moon Sync Service will require
 the following Personal Information and Potentially Personal Information
 from you: your email address and password. We will not 
make any of this information public. Your email address and password are
 transferred to us using SSL encryption. Your email address 
is used by us to provide you with the service, such as allowing us to help 
you recover your account if you lose your password. (Feel free to use a separate
 email account set up just for using the Pale Moon Sync Service if you&#8217;d 
like.) Your password is only retained on our servers in an encrypted format (which means that your actual password
cannot be recovered from it).</p>
 
        
      <p>As part of registration, you will also create a recovery key. However, the Pale Moon Sync Service is designed so that your 
recovery key resides only on your computer and is never transmitted to the 
Pale Moon Sync servers or to us. </p>

        
      <p>Once
you have registered, your password and recovery key are used to help
prevent unauthorized access to your account and User Data. </p>

        
      <h4>Encrypted User Data</h4>

        
      <p>The
Pale Moon Sync Service encrypts User Data on your computer and uploads
only pre-encrypted User Data over the network, additionally using SSL
communication for such data transfers. We believe that user privacy is
extremely important, and we require that the User Data is encrypted to
reside on our servers. Those items you choose to synchronize across
browsers or devices using Pale Moon Sync are examples of User Data that
is encrypted by design before leaving your computer. These can include
your browsing history, form history, bookmarks, saved passwords,
preferences, and open tabs.</p>

        
      <h4>Data Used to Provide the Services</h4>

        
      <p>We receive and use the following information for the 
purpose of providing and improving the Pale Moon Sync Service: IP address,
 login credentials, date and time of accessing the Pale Moon Sync Service, and 
various types of operational data such as the type of client OS and browser 
version.</p>

        
      <p>The Pale Moon Sync Service also receives the host names you 
have given your devices that you are syncing. These names are used to 
label your tabs within Pale Moon Sync. If you don&#8217;t want to share your 
name, you should consider naming your devices with fanciful names rather
 than your actual name. This information is also transmitted via SSL and cannot be observed by third parties. </p>

        
      <h4>Disclosure to Third Parties</h4>

        
      <p>To safeguard your privacy, the Pale Moon Sync Service is 
purposely designed so that the amount of data that we have access to
 is limited, either by encryption or by not collecting it in the first 
place. This is why User Data and your password and recovery key are 
either encrypted before being sent to our servers or not sent to 
our servers at all. This is also why we don&#8217;t collect 
other information at all like your name or phone number.<br>
For the set of
 information that we do have, we will not knowingly disclose 
Personal Information or Potentially Personal Information to third 
parties unless legally required to do so, such as in order to comply with any 
law, regulation, or valid legal process, such as a search warrant, 
subpoena, statute, court order, or if necessary or appropriate to 
address an unlawful or harmful activity. Do note, however, that even in 
this case the key required to decrypt the User Data
 portions of your data resides solely on your computer and not on ours,
and access to your User Data will remain impossible without it.<br>
</p>
      <p>No legal or governmental entity will be able to access User
Data that is sent to use by using the Pale Moon Sync Service by design.
While we will comply with any official request for User Data as
outlined in the previous paragraph as part of due process, this User
Data cannot be decrypted, analyzed or used without your key and will
therefore be useless to any entity requesting this data unless they
also obtain the key from you.<br>
It is your responsibility as a user to keep your recovery key safe to prevent access to your User Data.<br>
      </p>


        
      <h4>What Data is Analyzed by us?</h4>

        
      <p>We will only 
use Usage Statistics to understand your use of the Pale Moon Sync 
Service.</p>

        
      <h4>How Are the Usage Statistics Used?</h4>

        
      <p>We will use the Usage Statistics gathered through the 
operation of the Pale Moon Sync Service as part of normal operation of the Pale Moon Sync servers. By identifying patterns
 and trends in usage, we will be able to improve users&#8217; experiences, both in terms of 
content and ease of use.</p>

        
      <h4>Where is the Operational Data Available?</h4>

        
      <p>Operational data is considered part of the internal
administrative tasks of running the service and will not be made public
, nor shared with anyone outside of the organization structure
providing you with the Service.<br>
      </p>

        
      <h3>How to Disable or Opt-Out of Pale Moon Sync</h3>

        
      <p>If at any time, you decide you no longer want to have the 
Pale Moon Sync Service, you may disable the use of it from the Pale Moon preferences window.</p>

      <h3>Transfer of Data to another country<br>
      </h3>
        
      <p>Privacy laws and common practices vary from country to 
country. Some countries may provide for less legal protection of your 
personal data; others may provide more legal protection. By using the 
Pale Moon Sync Service, you consent to the transfer of the information 
collected, as outlined by this Policy, to us in the country where the Sync server is located (currently Germany), 
which may potentially provide a lesser level of data security than in your country 
of residence.</p>

        
      <h3>Data Retention</h3>

        
      <p>We will retain any information collected for the period 
necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy unless a 
longer retention period is required by law and/or regulations.</p>

        
      <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

        
      <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. 
Each time you use the Pale Moon Sync Service, the current version of this 
Privacy Policy will apply. Any and all changes will be reflected on this
 page. You should periodically check this page for any changes to the 
current policy. To make your review more convenient, we will post an 
effective date at the top of this page. Material changes will also be 
announced through the normal channels like the forum. It is your responsibility to 
ensure that you understand the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        
      <h3>What This Privacy Policy Doesn&#8217;t Cover</h3>

        
      <p>This policy does not apply to other Pale Moon websites, 
products, or services. It also does not apply to your use of non-Pale Moon Sync servers. If 
you choose to use a Sync server provided by an entity
 other than us, this policy does not apply and we assume no 
liability whatsoever for such services. </p>
