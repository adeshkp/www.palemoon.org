      <h3>Terms of Service - Overview</h3>
For your convenience, these terms are summarized as follows to provide
you with a quick overview of the rules applicable to the Pale Moon Sync
service in plain English.<br>
If you consider using this service, it is strongly recommended that you
read the entire Terms of Service before agreeing to them when creating
an account. Creating an account constitutes your full acceptance and
understanding of the terms.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>The Pale Moon Sync Service supplied by Moonchild
Productions allows you to synchronize information stored in your Pale
Moon browser such as your bookmarks, saved passwords, browsing history,
preferences, and open browser tabs, between the various computers on
which you have installed Pale Moon.</li>
        <li>These Terms of Service only apply to the synchronizing
service we provide.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The data you sync is your data and remains your data. Your
data is encrypted and we can&#8217;t see, access or use it.</li>
        <li><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">The
Pale Moon Sync Service is provided "as-is" and there
are no guarantees of any kind, including fitness for any particular
purpose</span>.</li>
        <li><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Pale
Moon and Moonchild Productions will accept absolutely
no liability of any kind for your use of this service</span>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
      <div style="text-align: right;">Last Updated: July 14<sup>th</sup>,
2019.<br>
      </div>
      <h4>Acceptance</h4>
      <p>These Terms of Service (the "ToS") govern your use of the Pale
Moon Sync Service (the "Service"). By registering for and/or using the
Service you are agreeing to abide by the terms and conditions described
below. This is an agreement between you, the end user ("you"), and
Moonchild Productions/Moonchild (Mr. M.C. Straver BASc)/Pale Moon
administrators/server operators ("we", "us", etc.).<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Use of the Services</h4>
      <p>To
use the Service you must first register. During
registration you will need to provide your email address, which will be
your username, and create a password (collectively "Account Data").
This Account Data will be sent
to Pale Moon servers, using Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology
to
encrypt them during transit, when you register. Both your e-mail and
password will be
stored on our server
in an encrypted form. The form of encryption used prevents anyone
(including us) from
stealing your actual password or discovering your e-mail address, but
still allows us to check your authentication you
when you sign in to the Service. During sign-up, a secret key used to
encrypt your data is also created on your computer.
The secret key is stored only on your computer and is not sent to us in
any form.</p>
      <p>You may use the Service only for purposes that are permitted
by (i) the ToS and (ii) the laws and regulations in your
state/province/region and
country and any other laws and regulations that apply to your use of
the Service (including any laws regarding the export of data or
software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
Please note that your use of the Service may not be authorized in
jurisdisctions that do not allow disclaiming of warranties or
limitations of liabilities. Unauthorized use of the Service is
prohibited.<br>
      </p>
      <p>You may use the service to synchronize data between instances
of Pale Moon and potentially other Sync 1.1 compliant clients. This
data comprises bookmarks, browsing history, form history, passwords, a
selection of browser preferences, open tabs, and any other collections
of data sent by the client (collectively "User
Data"). You acknowledge and agree that your User Data will be stored on
the Pale Moon Sync server (in encrypted form) to facilitate this
synchronization process. Although User Data is stored on our server as
part of this
process, the primary function of the Sync server is and remains
synchronization, not storage for e.g. back-up. Using the Service as a
remote storage or backup medium is not intended use, and unrecoverable
data loss may
occur at any time if used in such a fashion.<br>
      </p>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the
Service (or the servers and networks that are connected to the Service);</li>
        <li>Trade or resell the Service for any purpose;</li>
        <li>Access (or attempt to access) the Service by any means
other than the official Pale Moon browser, unless you have been
specifically allowed to do so in writing by the server operator and/or
Pale Moon project owner.</li>
        <li>An exception to the previous point is the personal use of
Sync on mobile devices, but only when using official builds of software
that is fully Sync 1.1 compatible and cause no other disruptions of, or
issues with, the Service and connected servers and networks.</li>
      </ul>
Limits on your use (fair use limits):<br>
      <ul>
        <li>If you use the Pale Moon Sync service in any sort of
sizable organization (more than a handful of users), then you are <span
 style="font-style: italic;">strongly</span> encouraged to run your own
Sync service instead of making disproportionate use of this free,
public instance of Sync.</li>
        <li>If your organization exceeds 50 individual devices or users
(whichever is larger), then your use of the free courtesy Pale Moon
Sync service is not authorized without express permission from us.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Your Acknowledgments</h4>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will only use the Service to access your own account
and User Data;</li>
        <li>User Data may be sent outside your country of residence;</li>
        <li>We have the right to manage the Service in a manner
designed to protect the rights and property of Moonchild Productions
and others and to facilitate the proper functioning of the Service,
including disabling your account if deemed necessary;<br>
        </li>
        <li>We may discontinue or change the Service at our sole
discretion
without liability. If we discontinue or change the Service, we will
announce it through the usual channels for such announcements such as
the forum.</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to deny access to any user, IP, net
block, client software or
territory that, in our opinion, causes interference with, or denial of,
service to other
users, or interferes with our operation of the Service for our users.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Limited storage</h4>
Limited time storage:<br>
This
Service will retain Account Data and User Data only for a limited time.
If the Service
is not actively used by a user, their Account Data and User Data stored
on the server will
be removed at our discretion to free up server resources for other
users who actively use the Service.<br>
As a general guideline, <span style="font-weight: bold;">User Data</span>
for accounts not actively used for more than <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">2 months</span> (no valid login to the
server for 2 months) will be removed from the server database, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Account Data</span> for accounts not used
for more than <span style="font-weight: bold;">3 months</span>
(no valid login to
the server for 3 months) will be removed from the server database in
any
scheduled or ad hoc maintenance window (either announced or not). If
you wish to retain your user account, you MUST actively use it. There
are no exceptions to this rule. If your account has been purged due to
inactivity, you may of course recreate your account.<br>
      <br>
Limited volume storage:<br>
This service has limited capacity which is shared among all users, and
it is the user's responsibility to keep their individual usage under
control. We reserve the right to, in our sole discretion, remove any
account or block access to the service from any account or IP we find
in excess of reasonable storage limits for this courtesy Sync service.<br>
As
a guideline, users should try to keep their data usage preferably
at less than 20MB, and should reduce their data storage if higher by
cleaning
up history or other synced data, or deselecting categories to
synchronize. Sync
client software will be able to query the server for volume quota in
use, and the server will refuse to store any data if you are exceeding
our set upper capacity limit. If you are close to or at this limit, you
should reduce your storage to prevent disproportional individual load
on the service.<br>
      <h4>Proprietary Rights</h4>
      <p>We do not grant to you any intellectual property rights in the
Service. For example, this ToS does not provide the right to use any of
our copyrights, trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain
names, or other distinctive brand features.</p>
      <p>The Pale Moon browser referred to in this agreement is
distributed under and subject to the
Mozilla Public License, and in binary form to the Pale Moon
redistribution license, located at http://www.palemoon.org/redist.shtml.</p>
      <p>"User Data" is the digital content stored on, manipulated by,
and
transmitted to and from Pale Moon Sync servers by means of your use of
the Service. Examples of User Data include your browsing history, form
history, bookmarks, saved passwords, preferences, and open tabs. You
own your User Data but you give us a license to store, transmit,
reproduce, and otherwise manipulate it as necessary to provide
the Service.</p>
      <h4>Transmission of User Data</h4>
      <p>You understand and agree that we, in performing the required
technical steps to provide the Service, may (i) transmit or distribute
your User Data over various public networks and in various media; and
(ii) make such changes to User Data as are necessary to conform and
adapt that User Data to the technical requirements of storage,
connecting
networks, devices, services or media. Provided you are using the Pale
Moon browser, during any such transmission, your User Data and Account
Data will be sent via TLS-protected connections.</p>
      <h4>Canceling the Service</h4>
      <p>You can discontinue use of the Service at any time. In the
Pale Moon browser go to "Preferences", category "Sync", and click
"Unlink this device". Do this on all synced computers. Note that as a
result of
our limited time storage policy, unlinking all devices and not actively
using your Sync account will have your data purged from our systems
automatically after a period of inactivity. This means you do not have
to take specific steps to have your data removed as it will naturally
expire. There is currently no
automated request procedure to have your encrypted data removed from
the Sync server.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We do not grant any manual removal requests of User Data from
the Pale Moon Sync server due to the fully-encrypted nature of both
your Account Data and User Data which prevents us from fully verifying
your credentials outside of your Sync Client login or disclosing your
password to us in cleartext, which is considered an unacceptable
requirement. In addition, manual removal from the database would
require manual steps to verify the request is legitimate and initiated
by you. Because storage of User Data and Account Data is time-limited
(see above), your data will be automatically purged after the various
inactivity periods have lapsed, without any further required action
from either you or us, further making manual removal unnecessary. By
using the service, you agree that your data may remain stored on our
servers for a limited time even after you cancel the service.<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Third Party Client Developers</h4>
      <p>Use of third party clients to access the Pale Moon Sync
Service is not permitted, with the exception of official, fully Sync
1.1 compliant, non-abusive mobile Sync clients.<br>
To systematically use the Pale Moon Sync service with other Sync
clients (e.g. other desktop web browsers), you need to contact the Sync
server
administrator (Moonchild) prior to use, so capacity considerations and
potential compensation can be discussed. Systematic use of these other
sync clients requires prior express
written permission from the server administrator.<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Updates to the Terms</h4>
      <p>We may update this ToS from time to time, for example to
address a new feature of the Service or to clarify or change a
provision. The
updated ToS will be posted on the Pale Moon website. If the changes are
substantive, we will announce the update through the usual channels for
such announcements such as the forum. Your continued use of the Service
after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of
such changes. These terms may not be modified or cancelled without our
written agreement.</p>
      <h4>Disclaimer of Warranty</h4>
      <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">The Service is
provided "as-is" with all faults. To the extent
permitted by law, Moonchild Productions, its distributors,
contributors, and licensors hereby disclaim ALL warranties, either
express or implied, including without limitation warranties that the
Service is free of defects, merchantable, fit for any particular
purpose and non-infringing. You bear the entire risk as to selecting
the Service for your purposes and as to the quality and performance of
the Service, including without limitation the risk that your User Data
is deleted, lost or corrupted.<br>
      </p>
      <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Some
jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, in which case your use
of the Service is not authorized. The service is used solely at your
own
risk, regardless of legal precedent.<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
      <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Moonchild
Productions, its distributors, contributors, and
licensors, will not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental,
consequential or exemplary damages arising out of or in any way
relating to this ToS or the use of or inability to use the Service,
including without limitation damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, lost profits, loss of data, and computer failure or
malfunction, even if advised of the possibility of such damages and
regardless of the theory (contract, tort or otherwise) upon which such
claim is based. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential or special damages, in which
case your use of the Service is not authorized.</p>
      <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
      <p>This ToS constitutes the entire agreement between you and us
concerning the Service. These terms are governed by the laws of Sweden.
If any portion of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. In the
event of a conflict between a translated version of these terms and the
English language version, the English language version shall control.</p>
