              General Information<br>
            </h3>The Pale Moon project is a community-driven project owned and led by Mr. M.C. Straver BASc, using
            contributed Open Source code to create a full-featured, optimized browser derived from the code behind the
            popular Firefox browser (Mozilla).<br>
            <br>
            Notable other development/maintainance contributors to the project are:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>G. Brown (access2godzilla), C. Ravenscroft and T. Wine for kicking off and maintaining the Linux
              builds &amp; installer<br>
              </li>
              <li>M. Turnbull (Sparky Bluefang) for supplying the base code for the V4+ status bar
              </li>
              <li>K. Engert for supplying the base code for the padlock feature</li>
        <li>Kailapis for supplying the base code for ruby annotations<br>
        </li>

              <li>M. Tobin for additional research into the Mozilla code and general support in a number of different
              areas of development
              </li><li>R. Crellin for adapting and maintaining many of the complete themes for Pale Moon
              </li>
            </ul>Pale
Moon aims to provide a browser with a large degree of freedom in how
people want to browse the web, which tools or extensions
they wish to use, and which feedback users want to see ("Your browser,
Your way"â„¢); efficiency, after all, should not stop at the engine of a
browser, but extend to all parts of it, including the user interface by
sticking to standard user interface conventions and ergonomics,
as well as proper visual integration with the operating system.<br>
            <br>
Users will find a tried-and-tested user interface in the Pale Moon
browser, which, although very close to older versions of Firefox in the
way it looks and operates at first glance, is a different and modern,
actively-maintained product. Pale Moon will always aim to keep a very
high degree of available user-customization and extensibility, since
that has always been the main strength of Firefox in the past, and to
keep a consistent and logical look and feel to the browser overall.
Extension compatibility will remain relatively high with extensions
specifically
written for Firefox prior to Australis, although 100% compatibility of
extensions written for a different product can obviously not be
guaranteed since Pale Moon will run these extensions in a limited
compatibility mode. This is also why extensions can be written for Pale
Moon
exclusively and/or adapted to Pale Moon as an individual product
(unlike "re-branded Firefox rebuilds").<br>
            <br>
            <span class="bold">Pale Moon is a middle road</span>, cutting away support for particularly old hardware and
            operating systems to achieve a significant speed and efficiency increase, but not trying to squeeze the
            last few percent more out of it by limiting the range of systems it will run on even
            more.&nbsp;<span class="bold">Pale Moon aims to deliver above all a stable and smooth browsing
            experience</span>, and does not intend to or aim for high scoring in synthetic tests, as those are
            invariably not a good representation of typical use of a web browser in the real world.<br>
            <br>
            <span class="bold">Pale Moon will be released independently</span>,
as it uses a different source code and release plan, different
versioning scheme, and is not affiliated with or subject to either code
releases or publication plans of Mozilla. Pale Moon is an <span class="bold">independently</span> developed product <span class="italic">derived from</span> Mozilla/Firefox code, but will most certainly not be in any way bound to developments seen in the Mozilla corner.<br><span class="bold red"></span><br>
