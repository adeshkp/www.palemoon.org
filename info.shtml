            <h3>
              General Information<br>
            </h3>The Pale Moon project is a community-driven project owned and led by Mr. M.C. Straver BASc, using
            contributed Open Source code to create a full-featured, optimized browser based on the code behind the
            popular Firefox browser.<br>
            <br>
            Notable other development/maintainance contributors to the project are:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>G. Brown (access2godzilla), C. Ravenscroft and T. Wine for kicking off and maintaining the Linux
              builds &amp; installer<br>
              </li>
              <li>M. Turnbull (Sparky Bluefang) for supplying the base code for the V4+ status bar
              </li>
              <li>K. Engert for supplying the base code for the padlock feature
              </li>
              <li>M. Tobin for additional research into the Mozilla code and general support in a number of different
              areas of development<br>
              </li>
            </ul>Pale Moon aims to provide a Gecko-based browser with more freedom of choice than Mozilla Firefox in
            how people want to browse the web, which tools or extensions they wish to use, and which feedback users
            want to see ("Your browser, Your way"); efficiency, after all, should not stop at the engine of a browser,
            but extend to all parts of it, including the user interface. Specifically, Firefox has seen a redesign of
            the user interface after the visions of the Mozilla Firefox product directors and user experience team to
            provide a more minimalist interface; unfortunately also removing essential functions and making a few less
            logical design choices, confusing minimalism with cleanliness. Especially in Firefox 29, with "Australis",
            much more has been changed, breaking in many ways with previous versions, standard user interface
            conventions and ergonomics, as well as proper visual integration with the operating system.<br>
            <br>
            Users will find a tried-and-tested user interface in the Pale Moon browser, which, although very close to
            older versions of Firefox in the way it looks and operates, is a different product. Pale Moon will always
            aim to keep a very high degree of available user-customization and extensibility, since that has always
            been the main strength of Firefox in the past, and to keep a consistent and logical look and feel to the
            browser overall. Extension compatibility will remain high with extensions specifically written for Firefox
            prior to Australis, although 100% compatibility of extensions written for a different product can obviously
            not be guaranteed. This is also why extensions can be written for Pale Moon exclusively and/or adapted to
            Pale Moon as an individual product (unlike "re-branded Firefox rebuilds").<br>
            <br>
            <span class="c2">Pale Moon is a middle road</span>, cutting away support for particularly old hardware and
            operating systems to achieve a significant speed and efficiency increase, but not trying to squeeze the
            last few percent more out of it by limiting the range of systems it will run on even
            more.&nbsp;<span class="c2">Pale Moon aims to deliver above all a stable and smooth browsing
            experience</span>, and does not intend to or aim for high scoring in synthetic tests, as those are
            invariably not a good representation of typical use of a web browser in the real world.<br>
            <br>
            <span class="c2">Pale Moon will be released independent of Mozilla Firefox</span>, as it uses a different
            source code and release plan, and is not affiliated with or subject to either code releases or publication
            plans of the Mozilla Corporation; <span class="c3">the Mozilla rapid release schedule is not
            followed</span>. Pale Moon is an <span class="c2">independently</span> developed product <span class=
            "c4">based on</span> Firefox, but will most certainly not follow Firefox to the letter.<br>
            Pale Moon will be updated <span class="c2">only using select and relevant updates</span> of the Mozilla
            base (Gecko) source code and otherwise develop completely independently on top of the chosen version of the
            Gecko engine.<br>
            This also means that <span class="c2">Pale Moon will not be built based on beta, release candidate,
            milestone, or other development releases</span> of the Gecko source code (there will not be any Pale Moon
            "nightly", "aurora" or "beta" builds available to the public). <span class="c3">Only relevant "Release"
            source code will be used for any architecture, to ensure stability.</span><br>
