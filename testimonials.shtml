was
annoyed that every time I opened Firefox it would suck up RAM and give
me an instant BSOD. Pale Moon fixed that. <br>

windows tablet!</span> Well worth the download and the creator
(Moonchild) deserves two thumbs way, way up!"<br>

and I cannot help but feel that it is the best browser EVER!<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">I have tested numerous browsers</span>,
including Firefox, Chrome, Avant, Comodo Dragon, Lunascape, Citrio,
Torch browser, Green browser, Maxthon, K-Meleon, Opera, Otter browser,
Seamonkey, Internet Explorer, Swing browser, Superfast browser, Crazy
browser, Arora browser, World browser, QtWeb browswer, Waterfox,
Iceweasel, Cometbird browser, Superbird browser, Blackbird browser,
Baidu browser, Wyzo browser, and (of course) Pale Moon.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">All of them, with the
exception of Pale Moon, have a fatal flaw or two</span> that makes me
to trash it two days after installing.....
But..... Pale Moon is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!<br>
        <br>
After several years of using Pale Moon, I decided to give this
testimonial so that other people suffering from lags, crashes, etc. can
have a new life. :)<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thank you so much for making
Pale Moon.</span> Ever since I started to use it, my life has become
100x better.<br>
All my support is for you, Pale Moon!! :)"<br>

fast, stable, secure and is feature rich.</span> And another
interesting option is the use of Pale Moon own addons but also the
Firefox addons.<br>

used tons of different ones from many different countries and from
developers of various sizes, but this one puts them all to shame. <br>
        <br>
What really stands out the most to me is how uncluttered it is. It's
like looking through a window directly at the content; no spam, no
unnecessary features or toolbars; I can really dig that. <br>

        <br>
With me it's been the familiar story: been with Firefox for years,
stuck with it past FF29 because I liked the alternatives even less. At
the end it's been so bad that I used add-ons just to try to undo FF
nonsense.<br>
        <br>
Yesterday I found Pale Moon mentioned on a forum and immediately felt
at home with version 25.4.0 x64 for Linux. Importantly I am now rid of
FF's baggage: becoming more and more like Chrome; adding nonsense bloat
between releases; trying to "promote openness, innovation &amp;
opportunity on the Web" by having a Corporation -- <span class="c3">yeah,
right</span>.<br>
        <br>
Firefox is now gone from my system, and it's gone for good.<br>

done right"."<br>

Firefox 29.<br>
        <br>
I did a fresh install of Xubuntu 14.04 and good grief - it came with
FF29. I did my best to work with it, and installed one addon after
another trying to get back the functionality that was lost. Some things
I could restore, some things - like back and refresh buttons - were
fixed and unchangeable. On top of it, most of my addons had issues with
Australis.<br>
        <br>
These changes were made for NO good reason except to mimic Chrome. Duh
- if I wanted to use Chrome I would. I wouldn't need a knock-off.<br>
        <br>
Reading other people voicing their mutual discontent and recommending
Pale Moon lead me to look into it. Lo and behold, <span class="c2">there
is a Linux version</span>. I installed 24.6.0 on my desktop (Xubuntu
14.04), and 24.6.1 just now on my laptop (Xubuntu 12.04 LTS).<br>
        <br>
So far, both are running nicely. I wasn't able to use the migration
tool - it is Windoze only, so I wound up using FEBE and so far so good.
        <span class="c2">All my addons are working.</span> I am also <span class="c2">not seeing the constant stalling when loading web pages

found myself growing <span class="c2">increasingly frustrated</span>
with the laggy and jaggedly loading <span class="c2">Firefox 29</span>.
I couldn't rearrange the reload/stop buttons to where I wanted them and
the new look was just bland and unintuitive.<br>
        <br>
I discovered Pale Moon in a discussion on a forum and decided to try
out the 32 bit version. After installing I thought 'ugh great I'm going
to have to set up this entire browser from scratch, I can't be
bothered' so I uninstalled.<br>
        <br>
The next day, during another of Firefox 29s painfully long stalls, I
decided to have another go with Pale Moon. This time I tried the 64 bit
version and used the <span class="c2">Pale Moon Migration tool</span>.
I <span class="c2">could not have been more delighted</span> with the
result! All my bookmarks, bookmark toolbars, live bookmarks, add ons,
cookies, passwords were transferred perfectly. There was no more setup
needed. I felt like such a fool for not using the Migration tool in the
first place. <span class="c2">So easy!</span><br>
        <br>
This is my first day using Pale Moon and I have to say, so far it <span class="c2">beats Firefox in speed and ease of use</span>. It's not
lightning fast but as other users say, loading websites is a matter of
split seconds, as opposed to many seconds with FF 29. I haven't had one
slow down or lock up as yet and <span class="c2">I feel instantly at
home with the well-known interface</span>.<br>

If you're also tired of the direction Firefox is taking, but want to
use something similar in user experience and UI as earlier versions of
Firefox, this is the answer. <span class="c2">Pale Moon brings back so
many features you might have been missing in recent version of Firefox,

I am currently using the 64-bit version, haven't tried 32-bit and
probably won't. So far, every plugin I've tried has worked with the

      <blockquote> "Things like this don't happen in <span class="c5">my</span>
dreams! Today I was in a state of exasperation with Firefox 29. I had
finally restored its interface <span class="c3">tolerably</span> using
the Classic Theme Restorer, but the tabs were too tall and I could find
no way to fix that. That wasn't the end of the world, but in the course
of my searching for a fix I saw mention of Pale Moon in a forum post,
and downloaded it just for the hell of it, not really expecting
anything really worthwhile.<br>
        <br>
To my surprise, Pale Moon turns out to be <span class="c2">just what
I've been wanting for yonks</span>, and to my amazement I've now
relegated Firefox to the wings and will most likely actually boot it
off my computer altogether very soon! <span class="c2">Pale Moon has
all the great things of Firefox</span>, including all the add-ons that
I've found so useful, yet <span class="c2">none of the down-sides of
all the ghastly 'improvements'</span>, and even a promise of nothing
like that awkward and confusing Firefox Australis theme, thank goodness!<br>
        <br>
Also, as a great bonus, I find that Pale Moon loads large or complex
pages for me much faster than recent versions of Firefox have been
doing. That isn't Internet performance - I've noticed this with my own
local copies of my web pages. Some would take about 3 to 5 seconds to
load in Firefox, but no more than .25 seconds in Pale Moon. Thank you
really greatly, Pale Moon developer - <span class="c2">a brilliant
piece of work and expression of user-respecting sanity!</span>"<br>

and I have to say it's quite stable. The difference in memory use from
the original mozilla builds is quite remarkable, although processor use
is almost double that of Mozilla.<br>
I've used every mozilla build possible:<br>
Aurora, Nightly, Waterfox, Firefox, and even the IceDragon supplied by
Comodo.<br>
I used Nightly a lot, because it was 64 bit, but after getting a
serious crash and not being able to make it work again even after a
complete uninstall and fresh reinstall, i had to let it go. I wanted to
come back to it but since Mozilla dropped support for 64-bit i didn't.<br>
Aurora seemed a bit of the same.<br>
        <br>
Firefox got heavier and heavier and IceDragon is just a resource hog
and it lags a lot. I don't know what security improvements and or
add-ons are there but it's way too heavy on resources.<br>
I had waterfox for a few weeks than i started to experience crashes
more often than firefox so I uninstalled that too.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="c2">Pale Moon seems to do the job right</span>, it
has everything Firefox does, it's lighter on resources, it's a smaller
package, a bit faster and doesn't take so much RAM away from me. I
didn't get any crash from this so far and I've used it for almost
everything.<br>
        <br>
Although other browsers score higher on reviews, few people actually
know that even though Firefox is slower it displays the pages a lot
more accurately than the others, doesn't mess up text or pictures or
java/ flash and so on. I'm glad to realize that Pale Moon retains that
from Firefox.<br>
        <br>
I like the fact that it's a 64 bit version, i also like the fact that
it's under development and i can rely on it to grow and be faster and
even more optimized and I hope to see tests that completely crush the
competition. Other than processor improvements I'd also like to see
optimizations for graphics cards. and other visual aids like the
progress bar from safari while loading a page and so on.<br>
I'm going to keep using it untill something goes terribly wrong but by

browsers and builds, since moving my computing needs over to a
netbook/tablet. I'm currently running Win 7 HP on a Lenovo S10-3T, with
a limited N455 1.66GHz Intel Atom processor and 1GB of ram. In addition
to this, I even have a 4GB SDHC card dedicated only to Readyboost.<br>
        <br>
I've tried everything from the lighter IE9, builds of Chrome and
Chromium (including Rockmelt) to Opera and browsers with a lower market
share such as Avant, in search of something powerful enough, but light
enough for my computing needs. I needed something that <span class="c3">didn't</span>
hog both CPU and RAM resources, which is why I've stayed away from the
Firefox builds. After reading many reviews and conducting many
searches, I lucked out and came across Pale Moon, my blessing in
disguise.<br>
        <br>
This browser <span class="c2">is definitely in tune with Windows</span>
and is very light on resource usage. I'm currently running v9.2 with at
least 10 addons in the background (including, but not limited to yoono,
365scores, Forecastfox, etc.). Under normal usage on my configuration,
resource usage for RAM increases to around 100-150MB, CPU load is
barely noticeable as well. This is running an average of 4-5 tabs open
at once, since I like to search topics and open multiple tabs before I
view them. Out of curiosity, I even opened up a youtube tab and hulu
tab to see if I could 'bog down' my system. To my surprise, it kept
chugging along, with real usability.<br>
        <br>
This browser is definitely awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone
looking for power and real functionality, but at the same time
something light enough to be barely noticed in the background. My kudos
go out to the developer of this browser and his hard work in his free
time is definitely appreciated by this user!"<br>

I downloaded, installed and browsed with it. It performed well and I
found myself begrudgingly impressed as I am most browser-jaded. I
imported my bookmarks from an HTML file before I realized I was
enjoying myself. So I decided to drive it harder.<br>
I opened tab after tab, all graphics and/or flash heavy, and it didn't
even hiccup. So I left them open while I downloaded a few PDF and video
files. I think there may have been a few seconds pause on tab number
eleven when I went to view it so, of course, I had to check for updates
to add-ons as well. That'll crash it, right? <span class="c3">Wrong.</span><br>

failures that Chrome, IE &amp; Firefox give me for the same content.
Sure they would recover, but I don't do that anymore with Pale Moon -
hell of a great browser!<br>
        <br>
I give it five stars!"<br>
