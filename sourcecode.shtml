      <h1> Pale Moon source code </h1>
This page is intended mainly for people interested in the code changes
and people needing to audit the browser code for security purposes. <span
 class="c2">As a regular user, you don't need the source code of the
browser.</span><br>
      <br>
      <h2> Downloading the source code </h2>
To download the source code for current and a limited number of past
versions,
check the source code release on GitHub:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><big><a
 href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/UXP/releases">https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/UXP/releases</a></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
To download previous (archived) versions of the source code for older
versions of Pale Moon, these are provided <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">for historical reference only</span> at the
archival FTP site:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><big><a
 href="ftp://archive.palemoon.org/source/">ftp://archive.palemoon.org/source/</a></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Debug symbols:</span> If you
want to debug Windows release builds and need the debug symbols for it,
you can find the symbols for individual releases matching the release
binaries at <a href="ftp://archive.palemoon.org/symbols/">ftp://archive.palemoon.org/symbols/</a><br>
      <br>
      <a href="ftp://source:get@archive.palemoon.org/"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> The source code
archive above is for the main-line x86/x64 release
version of Pale Moon. If you are interested in
other development branches or other code points, then please check the
git repository linked
to below where you can find additional archives.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="c2">If you want to contribute:</span>
The source code archives are snapshots of the actual releases of Pale
Moon, and since it is being actively developed, any patches you may
want to contribute should usually <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span>
be made against these source code
archives, but against the working development branch instead. This can
be found in the live repository on GitHub at the following URL, which
also has archives available for all tagged releases:<br>
      <div class="c3"> <a

      <h2> Hints for building Pale Moon 28 yourself </h2>
Please use binaries supplied by us where possible, since we cannot
provide much (if any) support for builds in unknown environments.<br>
      <br>
If you want to build release versions of Pale Moon from source
yourself, a few pointers:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>You have to <span style="font-weight: bold;">make sure you
are on the current release/development branch</span>.
Our "trunk" (master) branch is not suitable to build release-grade
versions since that is where the tip of our development takes
place.<br>
For release versions, check out <span style="font-family: monospace;">{version}_RelBranch</span>,
or specific release-tagged commits.<br>
        </li>
        <li>For <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows</span>, you
will need exactly <span style="font-weight: bold;">Visual
Studio 2015</span> (either the free Community Edition or the full
commercial package). It will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
properly build on versions of Visual Studio other than VS2015.<br>
In its current state, Pale Moon will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
build on VS 2017 Community or
Full due to breaking changes in the MSVC compiler. </li>
        <li>For <span style="font-weight: bold;">Linux</span>, you
will need to use <span style="font-weight: bold;">GCC</span>
(clang is not currently supported as a stable compiler), 7.*
strongly recommended but other versions might work too. We do not
support
particularly old versions of GCC (&lt; 4.9). v6.* is not recommended
due to its too-aggressive optimizations (YMMV). See also requirements
on the <a href="http://linux.palemoon.org/">Pale
Moon for Linux site</a>!<br>
        </li>
        <li>You
will need to get the build prerequisites as outlined on the Mozilla
Developer Network. Most notably, you need the Mozilla Build Tools
package (2.1-2.2, other versions may or may not work) if building on
Windows. </li>
        <li>Pale Moon <span class="c2">should not</span> be built with
PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization) or LTO (Link-time optimization).
Doing so will likely cause build errors or at the very least result in
an unstable or slow browser. Due to the size of our code base, these
optimizations are both pushing the limits of compilers and will not
result in any noticable improvement -- more likely the opposite.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Do not build tests. Building tests may or may not work on
your platform/configuration, and significantly increases build time for
no gain unless you plan on doing automated testing with the Mozilla
test harness (we don't provide support for using this test harness).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Pale Moon has been primarily designed for Windows and
Linux, and the necessary default-theme changes were made to the
relevant themes only. If you want to build for other platforms then be
aware that the browser will look different and may need some serious
tweaking to be usable or look similar to the Windows/Linux version.<br>
        </li>
