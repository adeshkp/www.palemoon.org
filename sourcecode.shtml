            The source code archive above is for the main-line x86/x64 release version of Pale Moon. If you are
            interested in other release branches like the Atom source, please check the git repository linked to below.<br>

            <span class="c2">If you want to contribute:</span> These source code archives are snapshots of the actual
            releases of Pale Moon, and since it is being actively developed, any patches you may want to contribute
            should usually not be made against these source code archives, but against the working development branch
            instead. This can be found in the live repository on GitHub at the following URL:<br>

            <h2>
              Hints for building Pale Moon yourself
            </h2>If you want to build Pale Moon from source yourself, a few pointers:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>For Windows, you will need <span style="font-weight: bold;">Visual Studio 2012</span> (either the free Express version or the full commercial
              package). Even though it <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> possibly build with VS 2010, there will likely be some snags. It will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
              properly build on versions of Visual Studio older than VS2010.<br>
In its current state, Pale Moon will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> build on VS 2013 Community or
Full due to breaking changes in the MSVC compiler. </li>
              <li>For Linux, you will need to use GCC (clang is not currently producing stable builds on Linux), 4.7.*
              recommended but later versions might work too. We do not support particularly old versions of GCC (&lt; 4.6).<br>
              </li>
              <li>You will need to get the build prerequisites as outlined on the Mozilla Developer Network. Most
              notably, you need the Mozilla Build Tools package (1.8-1.10, other versions may not work) and DirectX SDK
              if building on Windows.
              </li>
              <li>Pale Moon <span class="c2">should not</span> be built with PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization). Doing
              so will likely not build or at the very least result in an unstable browser.
              </li>
              <li>Pale Moon has been primarily designed for Windows and Linux, and the necessary theme changes were
              made to the relevant themes only. If you want to build for other platforms (e.g. Mac) then be aware that
              the browser will look different and may need some serious tweaking to be usable or look similar to the
              Windows/Linux version.<br>
              </li>
            </ul><br>
