check the source code archives on ftp: <a

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> The source code
archive above is for the main-line x86/x64 release
version of Pale Moon on a Windows file system. If you are interested in
other release branches or need unix-like file
system flags in your tree, then please check the git repository linked
to below where you can find additional source tree archives.<br>

      <span class="c2">If you want to contribute:</span>
These source code archives are snapshots of the actual releases of Pale
Moon, and since it is being actively developed, any patches you may
want to contribute should usually <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span>
be made against these source code
archives, but against the working development branch instead. This can
be found in the live repository on GitHub at the following URL, which
also has archives available for all tagged releases:<br>

      <h2> Hints for building Pale Moon yourself </h2>
Please use binaries supplied by us where possible, since we cannot
provide much (if any) support for builds in unknown environments.<br>
      <br>
If you want to build release versions of Pale Moon from source
yourself, a few pointers:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>You have to <span style="font-weight: bold;">make sure you
are on the current release/development branch</span>.
Our "trunk" (master) branch is not suitable to build release-grade
versions since that is where the tip of our development takes
place.<br>
For release versions, check out <span style="font-family: monospace;">{version}_RelBranch</span>,
or specific release-tagged commits.<br>
        </li>
        <li>For Windows, you will need <span style="font-weight: bold;">Visual
Studio 2013</span> (either the free Community Edition or the full
commercial package). It will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
properly build on versions of Visual Studio other than VS2013.<br>
In its current state, Pale Moon will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
build on VS 2015 Community or
Full due to breaking changes in the MSVC compiler. </li>
        <li>For Linux, you will need to use <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">GCC</span>
(clang is not currently producing stable builds on Linux), 4.9.*
recommended but later versions might work too. We do not support
particularly old versions of GCC (&lt; 4.6). GCC v5.* should work for a
basic (non-optimized!) build but may produce unstable builds with
certain optimizations, v6.* is experimental and not recommended (YMMV).<br>
        </li>
        <li>You
will need to get the build prerequisites as outlined on the Mozilla
Developer Network. Most notably, you need the Mozilla Build Tools
package (2.1-2.2, other versions may or may not work) if building on
Windows. </li>
        <li>Pale Moon <span class="c2">should not</span> be built with
PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization) or LTO (Link-time optimization).
Doing so will likely cause build errors or at the very least result in
an unstable browser.</li>
        <li>Do not build tests. Building tests may or may not work on
your platform/configuration, and significantly increases build time for
no gain unless you plan on doing automated testing with the Mozilla
test harness (we don't provide support for using this test harness).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Pale Moon has been primarily designed for Windows and
Linux, and the necessary default-theme changes were made to the
relevant themes only. If you want to build for other platforms then be
aware that the browser will look different and may need some serious
tweaking to be usable or look similar to the Windows/Linux version.<br>
        </li>
