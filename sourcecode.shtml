      <h1>Pale Moon source code</h1>
This page is intended mainly for people interested in the code changes
and people needing to audit the browser code for security purposes. <span style="font-weight: bold;">As
a regular user, you don't need the source code of the browser.</span><br>
      <br>
<h2>Downloading the source code</h2>
The source code of the current (main-line) release version:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><a class="dllink_blue" href="ftp://source:current@ftp.palemoon.org/palemoon-25.5.0-source.7z">Download current release version source code</a><br>
      </div>

<br>If you are looking for older versions of the source code, check the source code archives on ftp: <a href="ftp://source:get@ftp.palemoon.org/">ftp://source:get@ftp.palemoon.org/</a><br>
      The
source code archive above is for the main-line x86/x64 release version
of Pale Moon. If you are interested in other release branches, please
check the git repository linked to below.<br>
<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you want to contribute:</span>
These source code archives are snapshots of the actual releases of Pale
Moon, and since it is being actively developed, any patches you may
want to contribute should usually not be made against these source code
archives, but against the working development branch instead. This can
be found in the live repository on GitHub at the following URL:<br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/Pale-Moon">https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/Pale-Moon</a><br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<h2>Hints for building Pale Moon yourself</h2>If you want to build Pale Moon from source yourself, a few pointers:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>For
Windows, you
will need Visual Studio 2012 (either the free Express version or the
full commercial package). Even though it may possibly build with VS
2010, there will likely be some snags. It will not properly build
versions of Visual Studio older than VS2010. <br>In its current state, Pale Moon will not build on VS 2013 Community or Full.</li>
        <li>For Linux, you will need to use GCC (clang is not currently
producing stable builds on Linux), 4.7.* recommended but later versions
might work too.<br>
        </li>

        <li>You will need to get the build prerequisites as outlined on
the Mozilla Developer Network. Most notably, you need the Mozilla Build
Tools package (1.8-1.10, other versions may not work) and DirectX SDK if building on Windows.</li>
        
        <li>Pale Moon <span style="font-weight: bold;">should not</span>
be built with PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization). Doing so will likely
not build or at the very least result in an unstable browser.</li>
        <li>Pale
Moon has been primarily designed for Windows and Linux, and the necessary
theme changes were made to the relevant themes only. If you want to build
for other platforms (e.g. Mac) then be aware that the browser will
look different and may need some serious tweaking to be usable or look similar to the Windows/Linux version.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
