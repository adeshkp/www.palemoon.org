      <h2>Source Code</h2>
      <p>The Pale Moon browser is <a
 href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">open source</a> and <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>.
This means that it is not only available for download free of charge,
but you have access to the source code and may modify and redistribute
our software subject to certain restrictions. Our source code is for
the most part covered by the Mozilla Public License v2.0. <br>
      </p>
      <p> For more details, please read about our <a
 href="http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/">source code license</a>. To get a
complete overview of which part of this software is covered by which
free software license, type about:license in the address bar.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Trademarks</h2>
      <p> Although our code is free, it is very important to note that
we strictly enforce our trademark (™)
rights, in order to be able to protect our users against people who use
the marks to commit fraud. Our trademarks include, among others, the
names Pale Moon™ and "Your browser, Your way"™, as well as the Pale
Moon™ logo, Goanna™
logo and project names. This means that, while you have considerable
freedom to redistribute and modify our software, there are tight
restrictions on your ability to use the Pale Moon names and logos in
ways which fall in the domain of trademark law, even when included in
the source tree and built into
binaries that we provide for distribution.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In addition, we do use some of Mozilla's trademarks in our
communication, like Mozilla's
trademarks of Firefox® and XUL™. We honor and respect these trademarks
to belong to their respective owners and use them to refer to specific
products and technologies incorporated in, or in relation to, our work
(nominative use). </p>
      <p> For more detail on our trademark licensing, see our <a
 href="branding.shtml">Branding Policy</a> and <a href="redist.shtml">Redistribution
License</a>. If you still have questions after reading the policy,
please contact <a href="mailto:trademarks@palemoon.org">trademarks@palemoon.org</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Website Content</h2>
      <p>Pale Moon website content (i.e. text and pictures, not look
and feel) is generally licensed under Creative Commons Attribution
Share-Alike (CC-BY-SA) licenses. User-generated content, such as
comments on our blog posts or forum, are also generally made available
under CC-BY-SA. </p>
      <h2>Website Code</h2>
      <p> You may use the HTML and CSS files on www.palemoon.org or
other Moonchild Productions websites for your web site - as long as you
don't use the visual design or style (the colors, gradients, fonts,
etc.). In other words, you can use the HTML and/or CSS code, but your
page should not look like you took Pale Moon's page and dropped in your
logo. This does not grant you any right to use the trademarks, trade
names, service marks, or house style of Moonchild Productions. </p>
      <h2>Executable Software</h2>
      <p> Executable software binaries of core products released by
Moonchild Productions, such as Pale Moon, are made available under the
terms of the <a href="redist.shtml">binary redistribution license</a>.
This license also outlines the situation where binaries are built from
source with official branding.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Helper applications and tools may be made available under
different licenses like the <a href="freeware-license.shtml">Pale Moon
Freeware License</a> or MIT licenses -- please see the applicable page
of the tools or
utilities in question to see which license(s) apply.<br>
On some proprietary, non-free platforms, necessary binary components
subject to other licenses may be included in the installer or packaged
with the application. </p>
      <h2>Informative, Not Authoritative</h2>
      <p> This page is designed to inform, not to be the final,
authoritative reference. If you're looking to reuse or redistribute
something we have created, always check the licensing in the object of
interest itself (for example, in the footer of a web page, or in the
"About" box of software) after you've looked at this document. </p>
      <p> In case of a conflict between this document and other
documents (for example, if this document and the header file of a
particular source code file conflict) the other document should take
precedence. If you do discover such a conflict, please notify <a
 href="mailto:licensing@palemoon.org">licensing@palemoon.org</a> so we
can fix it. </p>
      <h2>Questions?</h2>
      <p> If, after reading all the above carefully, you have a further
question about the licensing terms of anything created by Moonchild
Productions or the Pale Moon project, please send the question to <a
 href="mailto:licensing@palemoon.org">licensing@palemoon.org</a>. </p>
