            <h3>
              General Information
            </h3>The Pale Moon project is a community-driven project, and as such the future roadmap of the browser is
            determined not only by what is decided by the project owner and other developers, but also by the
            community. There are occasional polls and constructive discussions on the forum that determine the
            inclusion and progress of certain features in the browser.<br>
            <br>
Pale Moon, over the course of its life, has been a product diverging
from its common Mozilla ancestor, with increasing differences between
Pale Moon and Mozilla-based browser products. This divergent path will
remain Pale Moon's future. To quote: "Pale Moon is not Firefox, and
will never be again."<br>
Of course there are a number of challenges on this kind of divergent
(some might even say rebellious) path, like adoption of the browser as
an independent force by the Internet community, and a number of
technical advances as the Web develops.<br>
            <br>Having a
common ancestor in Mozilla code, it can draw in part on the public
sources and feature developments in Mozilla products, and where
possible, desired features will be ported across or re-implemented
based on code from the Mozilla core code. However: Pale Moon will be
selective in what is adopted into its core from Mozilla or written to
implement features, and the
current feature set is and will always be different as a result. Pale
Moon does not aim to provide 100% parity with other browsers, but
rather to offer a sane balance of features and workflow to its users
now and in the future. Asking for such parity for specific features may
bring the attention to such features and result in an evaluation of
desirability based on the many factors involved, but never expect that
Pale Moon will implement something "just because such-and-such other
browser has it too".<br>
            <br>
            This is a preliminary document with forward-looking statements. Development of a complex piece of software
            like the Pale Moon browser depends on many factors, so this roadmap should be seen as an indication or
            general direction - and a dynamic document to be updated as the need arises to change plans around.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>
              Core Work
            </h3>Pale Moon's core is in flux, just like the web is. With the current practice of a total lack of
            standards and everyone implementing things based on draft specifications and recommendations instead of
            established standards, a lot of the features in Pale Moon are determined on an on-demand basis: If there is
            enough demand for a certain feature or if it is considered beneficial to the browser and the web, it will
            be implemented - other features may be put on hold or decided against altogether.<br>
      <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
One important thing to note is that the next milestone release that is
planned (v27, code-named "Tycho") will be a re-base on the last version of the Mozilla platform code
that is considered desirable for Pale Moon development, to overcome
some important, blocking issues that our current developers will not be
able to sufficiently tackle otherwise. Even so, this will not mean that
we are "going back to rebuilds of Firefox" like the start of this
project was; quite the opposite. This decision was made with
considerable community input and will take a good number of months to
bring to completion. This means that our previously outlined roadmap
(below) will change significantly as to what is and will be supported by the
browser. More on that later.</span><br>
            <br>
            It is beyond the scope of this document to list planned HTML/content improvements in Pale Moon in detail,
            since many of those are small, individual changes and additions (even though some require a lot of work to
            implement by re-writing parts of the parser and renderer in Pale Moon's core).<br>
      <br>
The status of planned improvements is, to some extent, available on the <a href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/Pale-Moon/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issues</a> page, although a number of those will be tackled by the re-base and will eventually be marked in the issue tracker as such.<br>
      <h4>Layout and Rendering</h4>
The current layout and rendering engine (Goanna) is Pale Moon's
independent implementation derived from Gecko. This engine debuted in
v26 of the browser, and aims to improve upon the previous Pale Moon
engine by steadily adopting more desired HTML and CSS features as well as improving rendering techniques. Some
implementations will be significantly different than those found in
other browsers, even Gecko-based ones, and aim to provide the best
solutions to web design problems.<br>

            <h4>
              JavaScript
            </h4>JavaScript
development is one of the ongoing focuses of the core work
performed on Pale Moon, and the next milestone will see a large amount of added
implementation of more of the ECMAScript version 6 (ES6) standard. Pale
Moon currently already supports everything in the actual ES5 standard,
but is being extended in current and future versions to offer web developers more "bleeding edge"
JavaScript features to work with from the ES6 standard over time. Please
understand that implementing these changes is slow and meticulous work
that requires extensive coding and testing to do properly. There is
very little margin for error, because JavaScript not only runs in
webpages in Pale Moon, but drives everything in the browser, including
many parts of the program itself.<br>
            <h4>
              Media support
            </h4>Media
support is a regularly-discussed topic for Pale Moon users, since part
of the user base would prefer a browser to also be a full-featured and
fully dedicated&amp;specialized media player. This is, however, not a
goal of Pale Moon because of the inherent shift of focus from document
content to media content. That being said, the Web has shifted to be
more visual-media heavy and as such will require a browser to at least
to some extent take on the media player role.<br>Specifically,
media should be delivered in a playable container format, but certain
streaming sites insist on trying to deliver their content in different
ways putting unnecessary demands on web clients. This kind of streaming
will always be a point of contention amont Pale Moon users but we will
do our best to strike a sane balance between usability and complexity.<br>
            <br>
            As such, the following specific media streaming feature(s) is/are <span class="c2">not</span> on Pale Moon's roadmap:<br>
            <ul><li>In-browser DRM (EME)</li>
            </ul>"Tycho" will, however, add the following media streaming features:<br>
      <ul>
<li>MSE (Media Source Extensions)
              </li><li>DASH support through MSE</li>
        <li>Better handling of fragmented media files<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
Current basic media support will be only extended where needed for regular data formats, and <span class="c3">already includes</span>:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>MPEG support
              </li>
              <li>Common streaming Open Source audio formats (ogg/vorbis/etc)
              </li>
              <li>H.264 on supported operating systems
              </li>
              <li>WebM/Theora containers
              </li>
              <li>VPX (VP8 and VP9) support
              </li>
              <li>High framerate and HD resolution support (subject to hardware limitations)
              </li>
              <li>Full-screen HTML5 video
              </li>
              <li>Plugin-based video formats (Flash/Silverlight/etc.)
              </li>
            </ul>There are currently no concrete plans to explicitly extend basic media support further, considering the already
            broadly-encompassing media support in the web browser.<sup></sup><br>
            <h3>
              Platform (operating system) support
            </h3>Pale Moon is originally a Microsoft Windows product.<br>
            On the roadmap are the following specific platforms to support in addition to Windows:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Linux (x86 and x64) -- Completed and actively maintained
              </li>
              <li>Mac OS X -- Currently in its early stages<br>There is some movement on this front and we hope to have an OS X version available later in the year<br>

              </li>
              <li>Android ARM -- Completed, but not actively developed due to lack of manpower<br>
We can use your help on this one (Fennec-based), especially for Android-L (5) compatibility
              </li>
              <li>Android-x86 -- Experimental (Fennec-based), no public releases<br>
              </li>
              
            </ul>
            <h3>
              Front-end
            </h3>Pale Moon's front-end features are well-established, tried-and-tested features that work well in terms
            of flexibility and customizability for users. The front-end is and will remain XUL-based and fully
            extensible by the user.<br>
            <h4>
              User Interface
            </h4>The
User Interface in Pale Moon is stable, based on the Firefox 4-28
browser era UI and will not be changed in any major way as far as how
the UI operates. "Australis", the UI rework done by Mozilla in Firefox
29 and later which completely removed many customization features, will
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> be adopted. This also means full and ongoing support for total restyling (complete
themes).<br>
      <br>
Even with the planned re-base on post-Australis platform code, we will
make every effort to retain our current setup and continue to provide
you with the fully customizable UI our users have preferred over the
years.<span class="c4"></span><span class="c4"></span><br>
            <br>
            <h3>Plug-ins</h3>Pale
Moon supports NPAPI plugins. Unlike Firefox, we will not be deprecating
or removing support for these kinds of plug-ins. This means that you
will be able to continue using your media, authentication, and other
plug-ins in Pale Moon like Flash, Silverlight, bank-authenticators or
networking plug-ins for specific purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Extensions and extension API
            </h3>
Pale Moon would not be complete without its support for Mozilla code extensions, of course, and the
            extension compatibility maintained in Pale Moon is purposefully kept (mostly) at the Firefox v24 front-end level. It
            provides compatibility with most of the browser extensions originally written for Mozilla Firefox (by
            accepting installations for Firefox application IDs) even though Pale Moon, from v25 onwards, is a
            different application altogether from an extension point of view.<br>
            <br>
The future of Pale Moon is to maintain this general level of compatibility with
traditional Firefox-targeted extensions, although the (transitional)
dual-ID setup will eventually be removed, at which point only Pale Moon
targeted extensions will be accepted. This will still allow developers
to target both Pale Moon and Firefox with specific code for them in a
single package, but Firefox-only extensions will not longer be accepted
by the browser when this lands.<br>
            <h4>
              XUL extensions
            </h4>This kind of extension uses the time-tested native extension capabilities to the browser XUL (UI
            markup) code, combined with JavaScript. <span style="font-weight: bold;">XUL extensions are strongly preferred because they are independent
            of browser-included libraries that may change over time.</span>
With Pale Moon aiming to keep approximate front-end compatibility with
v24 of Firefox, this is the API level that should be aimed for. "Tycho"
may need some changes to cater to some changed toolkit APIs.<br>
            <br>
            One issue with Pale Moon accepting Firefox IDed XUL extensions is the fact that this compatibility mode
            does not extend beyond the installation manifest. This is on purpose, to not break with the chrome manifest
            specification for application targeting. XUL extensions will therefore have to add manifest entries for
            overlays, skins and content if they target individual applications, now and in the future. Of course, it
            would be greatly preferred if extension developers, while doing this, actually add full installation
            support for Pale Moon as well, targeting Pale Moon's GUID of {8de7fcbb-c55c-4fbe-bfc5-fc555c87dbc4}.<br>
      <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Unlike Firefox, Pale Moon will continue to offer full support for XUL
and XPCOM binary-component extensions and there is no plan to discard the
current extension system</span> in lieu of Chrome-like alternatives (WebExtensions).<br>
Mozilla has already marked XUL extensions and bootstrapped extensions
as "legacy" and will be phasing out support for this, which will affect
many Firefox extensions. We have no plans to do this and many "legacy"
Firefox extensions will continue to be possible on Pale Moon when targeting it.<br>
            <h4>
              JetPack (Add-on SDK) extensions
            </h4>JetPack
(add-on SDK) add-ons are <span style="font-weight: bold;">deprecated</span> for Pale Moon, because they
inherently run into compatibility issues for multi-application
targeting due to its divergent nature from other Mozilla applications, and discrepancies in the browser-embedded SDK code.
In addition, with the front-end focus of Jetpack, there are big and
increasing issues with compatibility if you expect Firefox Jetpack extensions
to work on Pale Moon. Pale Moon's browser-included add-on SDK is
different than the one included in Mozilla Firefox, and extension code
targeted at one version will likely not be compatible with the other.<br>
            <br>
            For the time being, Pale Moon's add-on SDK is almost fully equivalent to v1.14 of the Mozilla add-on SDK,
            and this will be kept static for as long as the current release milestone is maintained.<br>
Important note: With "Tycho", <span style="font-weight: bold;">we will completely remove add-on SDK support for extensions</span>, at which point only the "classic" (i.e.: native code) XUL/bootstrapped extensions will be supported.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>
              Additional tools and services
            </h3>
            <h4>
              Pale Moon authored utilities
            </h4>Some of the tools used in conjunction with Pale Moon are due for an update. No solid date has been set
            for these improvements:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Improvement of the profile migration tool to deal with increasing issues with potentially installed
              and incompatible Firefox add-ons. (currently unavailable pending an update)
              </li>
              <li>Improvement of the web installer to offer automatic configuration based on a few different user
              templates.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
            <h4>
              Pale Moon Sync
            </h4>Pale Moon Sync is still lacking two features on the server side, which should be addressed. The
            following improvements are planned, although no date has been set for completion. Potentially, it requires
            hiring a PHP web developer to add the features:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Account deletion.<br>
                This would require the user's credentials (e-mail + password) to be entered, after which the user
                account and associated data are removed from the database.
              </li>
              <li>Password recovery.<br>
                Offering a password reset option by sending an e-mail to the user requesting this.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>
              Pale Moon start page
            </h4>We are partnered up with a start portal provider to improve the user experience on the Pale Moon
            Start page with customizability of shortcuts and localized content. This went live in the first
            quarter of 2015 and will likely remain the offered start page solution of choice.<br>
            <h4>
              Pale Moon add-on site services
            </h4>
            <p>
              The <a href="http://addons.palemoon.org/" target="_blank">Pale Moon add-on site</a> is a new service
              of the Pale Moon project. It came about when the decision was made to clearly separate ourselves from
              Mozilla, although the possibility of an independent add-ons site was already being considered before that
              point in time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The add-on site has its own specific roadmap, which has two (planned) generations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>first generation</strong> of the add-on site has three stages of development and uses off the
              shelf tools and readily available knowledge and experience to provide a growing feature set and service
              very quickly. This incarnation is managed wholly by the "Pale Moon Add-ons Team" and administrated by
              Matt A. Tobin with resources donated to the project by Binary Outcast. Add-on developers will not have
              direct access to publishing tools in this generation of the site.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Phase 1 - Launch (completed)
                <ul>

                  item)
                  </li>
                  <li>Contact add-on developers with requests for direct support for Pale Moon (This is a perpetual
                  item)
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  </li>
                  <li>Provide forks where needed and populate the listing of externals (those add-ons that do work and
                  are on AMO)
                  </li>
                  <li>Improve the user experience of add-on pages and secondary pages
                  </li>
                  <li>Assemble a team to increase productivity of the service
                  </li>
                  <li>Provide our own services through add-on manager integration and reduce 1:1 pass-through
                    <ul>
                      <li>Provide our own updates as well as updates through AMO

                  </li>
                  <li>Continue aforementioned contact with extension developers, including (where possible) working

                  </li>
                  <li>Provide an ancillary site for add-on developers with vital information and documentation
                    <ul>
                      <li>Including retrieving documentation obfuscated by Mozilla
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

              The <strong>second generation</strong> add-on site will be one that has been created from the ground up
              to serve the Pale Moon project and community. This incarnation will take a protracted period of time to
              materialize and planning is still in the most preliminary of stages.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, broad goals for the second generation site is to try and replicate core functionality from
              Mozilla's Add-on Site including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Accounting system
              </li>
              <li>Self-publishing and management of add-ons by add-on developers
              </li>
              <li>Proper integration of all add-on site services including those for the add-on manager
              </li>
              <li>All features from first generation add-on site
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The add-ons site is in a state of constant refinement and development as such we have set up a <a href="http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=44&amp;t=6144" target="_blank">forum thread</a> and <a href="https://addons.palemoon.org/announcements/" target="_blank">page</a> for announcements and updates
              pertaining to the add-ons site.
