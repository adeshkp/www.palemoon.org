      <h1> Pale Moon future roadmap</h1>
      <small>Last update: 2018-04-14</small><br>
      <h3> General Information </h3>
The Pale Moon project is a community-driven project, and as such the
future roadmap of the browser is determined not only by what is decided
by the project owner and other developers, but also by the community.
There are occasional polls and constructive discussions on the forum
that determine the inclusion and progress of certain features in the
browser.<br>
      <br>
Pale Moon, over the course of its life, has been a product steadily
diverging
from its common Mozilla ancestor, with increasing differences between
Pale Moon and Mozilla-based browser products. This divergent path will
remain Pale Moon's future. To quote: "Pale Moon is not Firefox, and
will never be again."<br>
Of course there are a number of challenges on this kind of divergent
(some might even say rebellious) path, like adoption of the browser as
a truly independent force by the Internet community, and a number of
technical advances as the Web develops.<br>
      <br>
Having a
common ancestor in Mozilla code, it can draw in part on the public
sources and feature developments in Mozilla products, and where
possible, desired features will be ported across or re-implemented
based on code from the Mozilla core code. However: Pale Moon will be
selective in what is adopted into its core from Mozilla or written to
implement features, and the
current feature set is and will always be different as a result. Pale
Moon does not aim to provide 100% parity with other browsers, but
rather to offer a sane balance of features and workflow to its users
now and in the future. Asking for such parity for specific features may
bring the attention to such features and result in an evaluation of
desirability based on the many factors involved, but never expect that
Pale Moon will implement something "just because such-and-such other
browser has it too".<br>
      <br>
This is a preliminary document with forward-looking statements.
Development of a complex piece of software like the Pale Moon browser
depends on many factors, so this roadmap should be seen as an
indication or general direction - and a dynamic document to be updated
as the need arises to change plans around.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Long-term plans</h3>
Our long-term plans for Pale Moon involve moving our
browser to UXP (the Unified XUL Platform) that is currently being
worked on alongside the browser. This will at its earliest be somewhere
in the summer of 2018, considering this involves a large amount of work
in
adaptation and testing to move the browser application code across to
the
new platform.<br>
This platform will continue to carry the Goanna engine, like the
current browser, albeit with many updates and rearchitecturing.<br>
      <br>
UXP is currently in a working state and porting of the Pale Moon
application is underway with promising preliminary results as far as
timeline is concerned. Pale Moon 27.* will be put in "maintenance mode"
to receive priority security and stability updates only, and our
unstable channel will be moved across to the new UXP-based Pale Moon
when the application reaches beta-stage quality.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Technology support</h3>
Pale Moon supports and will continue to support the following
features/technologies:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Full UI customization<br>
        </li>
        <li>Full theming (complete themes) and lightweight theming
(personas)<br>
        </li>
        <li>XUL
and XBL to build interfaces and applications (including the ability to
launch independent XUL-apps from the browser binaries).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Full support for NPAPI plug-ins<br>
        </li>
        <li>Overlay and bootstrapped extensions, including restartless
ones</li>
        <li>Access to low-level APIs from extensions, allowing them to
truly extend browser functionality<br>
        </li>
        <li>Pale Moon Sync (in the secure, time-tested Weave fashion)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Core Work </h3>
Pale Moon's core is in flux, just like the web is. With the current
practice of a total lack of standards and everyone implementing things
based on draft specifications and recommendations instead of
established standards, a lot of the features in Pale Moon are
determined on an on-demand basis: If there is enough demand for a
certain feature or if it is considered beneficial to the browser and
the web, it will be implemented - other features may be put on hold or
decided against altogether.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>It is beyond the scope of
this document to list planned HTML/content improvements in Pale Moon in
detail, since many of those are small, individual changes and additions
(even though some require a lot of work to implement by re-writing
parts of the parser and renderer in Pale Moon's core).<br>
      <br>
The status of planned improvements is, to some extent, available on the
      <a href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/Pale-Moon/issues"
 target="_blank">GitHub issues</a> page.<br>
      <h4>Layout and Rendering</h4>
The current layout and rendering engine (Goanna) is Pale Moon's
independent implementation derived from Gecko. This engine debuted in
v26 of the browser, and aims to improve upon the previous Pale Moon
engine by steadily adopting more desired HTML and CSS features as well
as improving rendering techniques. Some
implementations will be significantly different than those found in
other browsers, even Gecko-based ones, and aim to provide the best
solutions to web design problems.<br>
      <br>
Version 27 of the browser carries the engine and subsequently platform
version 3 of
Goanna. This tackles a few rather technical issues and improve
support for current operating systems and hardware - further
improvements will be made over time.<br>
      <br>
Version 28 of the browser, building on UXP, will carry the 4th
incarnation of Goanna, adding, among other things, support for WebGL2,
CSS Grid, and other recent additions to the layout and rendering
landscape for browsers.<br>
      <h4> JavaScript </h4>
JavaScript
development is one of the ongoing focuses of the core work
performed on Pale Moon, and the resulting
implementation in v27 has a lot more of the ECMAScript version 6 (ES6)
standard implemented than previous versions, which provides a solid
base for websites to build their scripting on.<br>
      <br>
With the move to UXP, we aim to have full and complete support for
ECMAScript (JavaScript) standards ES6, ES2016 and ES2017, with annexes,
in Pale Moon.<br>
      <br>
Please
understand that implementing these changes is slow and meticulous work
that requires extensive coding and testing to do properly. There is
very little margin for error, because JavaScript not only runs in
webpages in Pale Moon, but drives everything in the browser, including
many parts of the program itself.<br>
      <h4>Media support </h4>
Media
support is a regularly-discussed topic for Pale Moon users, since part
of the user base would prefer a browser to also be a full-featured and
fully dedicated&amp;specialized media player. This is, however, not a
goal of Pale Moon because of the inherent shift of focus from document
content to media content. That being said, the Web has shifted to be
more visual-media heavy and as such will require a browser to at least
to some extent take on the media player role.<br>
      <br>
The following specific media streaming feature(s) is/are <span
 class="c2">not</span> on Pale Moon's roadmap, regardless of version:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>In-browser DRM (EME)</li>
        <li>WebRTC streaming/peering</li>
      </ul>
This underlines one of the differences with Basilisk, the UXP
"reference application", which does provide these features from the
unified platform.<br>
      <h3> Platform (operating system) support </h3>
Pale Moon is originally a Microsoft Windows product.<br>
On the roadmap are the following specific platforms to support in
addition to Windows:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Linux (x86 and x64) -- Completed and actively maintained </li>
        <li>Mac OS X -- Currently in development<br>
There is some movement on this front and we hope to have an official OS
X version available later in the year<br>
        </li>
        <li>Android ARM -- Currently discontinued<br>
We do plan to lift Android development up to the new milestone after
desktop versions are released and have stabilized, if time and capacity
permits.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3> Front-end </h3>
Pale Moon's front-end features are well-established, tried-and-tested
features that work well in terms of flexibility and customizability for
users. The front-end is and will remain XUL-based and fully extensible
by the user and browser extensions, regardless of what platform is in
use.<br>
      <h4> User Interface </h4>
The
User Interface in Pale Moon is stable, based on the Firefox 4-28
browser era UI and will not be changed in any major way as far as how
the UI operates. "Australis", the UI rework done by Mozilla in Firefox
29 and later which completely removed many customization features, will
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> be adopted. This also
means full and ongoing support for total restyling (complete
themes).<br>
      <h4>Developer Tools</h4>
We <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>include
Web
Developer tools in our release versions of Pale Moon. These tools are
based on the Mozilla-adaptation of Firebug, and provide a fairly broad
set of tools for web developers and extension developers alike.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Plug-ins</h3>
Pale
Moon supports <span style="font-weight: bold;">NPAPI plug-ins</span>.
Unlike Firefox, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">we will not be
deprecating
or removing support for these kinds of plug-ins.</span> This means that
you
will be able to continue using your media, authentication, and other
plug-ins in Pale Moon like Flash, Silverlight, bank-authenticators or
networking plug-ins for specific purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Extensions and extension API </h3>
Pale
Moon would not be complete without its support for browser extensions,
of course, and the extension compatibility maintained in Pale Moon is
purposefully kept (mostly) at the Firefox v24-28 front-end level. It
provides compatibility with most of the browser extensions originally
written for Mozilla Firefox (by accepting installations for Firefox
application IDs) even though Pale Moon, from v25 onwards, is a
different application altogether from an extension point of view.<br>
      <br>
The future of Pale Moon is to maintain this general level of
compatibility with
traditional (XUL) Firefox-targeted extensions, although the
(transitional)
dual-ID setup will eventually be removed, at which point only Pale Moon
targeted extensions will be accepted. This will still allow developers
to target both Pale Moon and Firefox with specific code for them in a
single package, but Firefox-only extensions will not longer be accepted
by the browser when this lands.<br>
      <br>
Pale Moon v27 has been fitted with an indicator in the add-on manager
to make users aware which add-ons are native to Pale Moon and which are
running as "Firefox compatible", to assist in troubleshooting.<br>
      <br>
One issue with Pale Moon accepting Firefox IDed XUL extensions is the
fact that this compatibility mode does not extend beyond the
installation manifest. This is on purpose, to not break with the chrome
manifest specification for application targeting. XUL extensions will
therefore have to add manifest entries for overlays, skins and content
if they target individual applications, now and in the future. Of
course, it would be greatly preferred if extension developers, while
doing this, actually add full installation support for Pale Moon as
well, targeting Pale Moon's GUID of
{8de7fcbb-c55c-4fbe-bfc5-fc555c87dbc4}.<br>
      <h4> XUL extensions </h4>
This kind of extension uses the time-tested native extension
capabilities to the browser XUL (UI markup) code, combined with
JavaScript. <span style="font-weight: bold;">XUL extensions are
strongly preferred because they are independent of browser-included
libraries that may change over time.</span>
With Pale Moon aiming to keep approximate front-end compatibility with
v24 of Firefox, this is the API level that should be aimed for. <br>
      <br>
Version 27 of the browser
may need some changes to cater to some changed toolkit APIs (most
notably the way downloads and the find bar are handled).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Binary components in extensions</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unlike Firefox, Pale Moon will
continue to offer full support for XUL
and XPCOM binary-component extensions and there is no plan to discard
the
current extension system</span> in lieu of Chrome-like alternatives
(WebExtensions). <br>
Mozilla has already marked XUL extensions and bootstrapped extensions
as "legacy" and will be phasing out support for all but WebExtensions,
which will affect
many Firefox extensions. We have no plans to do this and many "legacy"
Firefox extensions will continue to be possible on Pale Moon when
targeting it.<br>
      <h4> JetPack (Add-on SDK) extensions </h4>
With Pale Moon v27, <span style="font-weight: bold;">no extensions of
this type are supported anymore</span>.<br>
As an alternative, a slightly-limited subset of the Jetpack SDK is
available in the new <span style="font-weight: bold;">PMkit</span> set
of libraries, included and available in
v27.1 and beyond, which will offer support for many <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">jpm</span>-based SDK
extensions. Extension developers can easily target this set of
libraries with a few simple changes and a build specifically for the
Pale Moon browser instead of Firefox.<br>
      <h4>WebExtensions</h4>
We will not be supporting WebExtensions of any kind in Pale Moon. Our
current extension technologies provide all the features, functionality
and above all API access for any extension to do anything it has to,
including the limited subset that is offered by WebExtensions.<br>
      <br>
      <h3> Additional tools and services </h3>
      <h4> Pale Moon authored utilities </h4>
Some of the tools used in conjunction with Pale Moon are due for an
update. No solid date has been set for these improvements:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Improvement of the web installer to offer automatic
selection/configuration based on a few different user templates. </li>
      </ul>
      <h4> Pale Moon Sync </h4>
Pale Moon Sync is still lacking two features on the server side, which
should be addressed. The following improvements are planned, although
no date has been set for completion. Potentially, it requires hiring a
PHP web developer to add the features:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Account deletion.<br>
This would require the user's credentials (e-mail + password) to be
entered, after which the user account and associated data are removed
from the database. </li>
        <li>Password recovery.<br>
Offering a password reset option by sending an e-mail to the user
requesting this.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4> Pale Moon start page </h4>
We are partnered up with a start portal provider to improve the user
experience on the Pale Moon Start page with customizability of
shortcuts and localized content. This went live in the first quarter of
2015 and will remain the offered start page solution of choice for the
foreseeable future.<br>
      <h4> Pale Moon add-on site services </h4>
      <p> The <strong>second generation</strong> add-on site will be
one that has been created from the ground up to serve the Pale Moon
project and community. This incarnation will take a protracted period
of time to materialize and planning is still in the most preliminary of
stages. </p>
      <p> However, broad goals for the second generation site is to try
and replicate core functionality from Mozilla's Add-on Site including: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accounting system </li>
        <li>Self-publishing and management of add-ons by add-on
developers </li>
        <li>Proper integration of all add-on site services including
those for the add-on manager </li>
        <li>All features from first generation add-on site </li>
      </ul>
      <p> The add-ons site is in a state of constant refinement and
development as such we have set up a <a
 href="http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=44&amp;t=6144"
 target="_blank">forum thread</a> and <a
 href="https://addons.palemoon.org/announcements/" target="_blank">page</a>
for announcements and updates pertaining to the add-ons site. </p>
