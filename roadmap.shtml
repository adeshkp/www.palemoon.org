      <h1> Pale Moon future roadmap</h1>
      <small>Last update: 2019-12-08</small><br>
      <h3> General Information </h3>
The Pale Moon project is a community-driven project, and as such the
future roadmap of the browser is determined not only by what is decided
by the project owner and other developers, but also by the community.
There are occasional polls and constructive discussions on the forum
that determine the inclusion and progress of certain features in the
browser.<br>
      <br>
Pale Moon, over the course of its life, has been a product steadily
diverging
from its common Mozilla ancestor, with increasing differences between
Pale Moon and Mozilla-based browser products. This divergent path will
remain Pale Moon's future. To quote: "Pale Moon is not Firefox, and
will never be again."<br>
Of course there are a number of challenges on this kind of divergent
(some might even say rebellious) path, like adoption of the browser as
a truly independent force by the Internet community and a number of
technical advances as the Web develops.<br>
      <br>
Having a
common ancestor in Mozilla code, it can draw in part on the public
sources and feature developments in Mozilla products, and where
possible, desired features will be ported across or re-implemented
based on code from the Mozilla core code. However: Pale Moon will be
selective in what is adopted into its core from Mozilla or written to
implement features, and the
current feature set is and will always be different as a result. Pale
Moon does not aim to provide 100% parity with other browsers, but
rather to offer a sane balance of features and workflow to its users
now and in the future. Asking for such parity for specific features may
bring the attention to such features and result in an evaluation of
desirability based on the many factors involved, but never expect that
Pale Moon will implement something "just because such-and-such other
browser has it too".<br>
      <br>
This is a preliminary document with forward-looking statements.
Development of a complex piece of software like the Pale Moon browser
depends on many factors, so this roadmap should be seen as an
indication or general direction - and a dynamic document to be updated
as the need arises to change plans around.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Long-term plans</h3>
Our long-term plans for Pale Moon involve continuing to build on UXP
(the Unified XUL Platform) that is currently being
worked on as a generic platform alongside the browser application.<br>
This platform will continue to carry the Goanna engine, like the
previous browser incarnations, albeit with many updates and
rearchitecturing.<br>
      <br>
Building on UXP brings a number of necessary advantages to Pale Moon
as an application, chief among them full ECMAScript 6 standard support,
and additional support for ES2016 and ES2017 drafts to bring the
browser's scripting and DOM capabilities on the level with what is
required by the current web. It is expected that this scripting storm
that has been raging for a few years will die down and allowing us to
keep pace with any new developments without being in any way lacking in
our support.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Technology support</h3>
Pale Moon supports and will continue to support the following
features/technologies:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Full UI customization<br>
        </li>
        <li>Full theming (complete themes) and lightweight theming
(personas)<br>
        </li>
        <li>XUL
and XBL to build interfaces and applications (including the ability to
launch independent XUL-apps from the browser binaries).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Full support for NPAPI plug-ins<br>
        </li>
        <li>Overlay and bootstrapped (restartless) extensions</li>
        <li>Access to low-level APIs from extensions, allowing them to
truly extend browser functionality, and not just manipulate web content<br>
        </li>
        <li>Pale Moon Sync (in the secure, time-tested Weave fashion);
it will be able to use any Weave Sync 1.1 compatible server, including
some FOSS cloud solutions.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
What is explicitly <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">not</span> on
our roadmap:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>In-browser DRM. We continue to support DRM-capable NPAPI
plugins like Silverlight as an alternative.<br>
        </li>
        <li>WebRTC (Web Real-Time Chat) and media capture.</li>
        <li>Integration of "features as a service" like Mozilla has
been doing.</li>
        <li>WebVR and similar "gadgeteering" APIs.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Extension signing.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Core Work </h3>
Pale Moon's core is in flux, just like the web is. With the current
practice of a total lack of standards and everyone implementing things
based on draft specifications and recommendations instead of
established standards, a lot of the features in Pale Moon are
determined on an on-demand basis: If there is enough demand for a
certain feature or if it is considered beneficial to the browser and
the web, it will be implemented - other features may be put on hold or
decided against altogether.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>It is beyond the scope of
this document to list planned HTML/content improvements in Pale Moon in
detail, since many of those are small, individual changes and additions
(even though some require a lot of work to implement by re-writing
parts of the parser and renderer in Pale Moon's core).<br>
      <br>
The status of planned improvements is, to some extent, available on the
      <a href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/UXP/issues"
 target="_blank">GitHub issues</a> page.<br>
      <h4>Layout and Rendering</h4>
The current layout and rendering engine (Goanna) is Pale Moon's
independent implementation derived from Gecko. This engine debuted in
v26 of the browser, and aims to improve upon the previous Pale Moon
engine by steadily adopting more desired HTML and CSS features as well
as improving rendering techniques. Some
implementations will be significantly different than those found in
other browsers, even Gecko-based ones, and aim to provide the
best-of-class
solutions to web design problems.<br>
      <br>
Version 28 of the browser carries the engine and subsequently platform
version 4 of
Goanna. This adds, among other things, support for WebGL2,
CSS Grid, and other recent additions to the layout and rendering
landscape for browsers - further
improvements will be made over time, as required.<br>
      <h4>JavaScript </h4>
JavaScript
development is one of the ongoing focuses of the core work
performed on Pale Moon, and the resulting
implementation in v28 is mostly feature-complete in terms of the
ECMAScript (JavaScript) standards ES6, ES2016 and ES2017, with annexes.
We are aiming to implement all <span style="font-style: italic;">important</span>
ES2018 and ES2019+ features as well, over time, when the various
proposals reach sufficient maturity.<br>
      <br>
Please
understand that implementing these changes is slow and meticulous work
that requires extensive coding and testing to do properly. There is
very little margin for error, because JavaScript not only runs in
webpages in Pale Moon, but drives everything in the browser, including
many parts of the various UXP programs themselves.<br>
      <h4>Media support </h4>
Media
support is a regularly-discussed topic for Pale Moon users, since part
of the user base would prefer a browser to also be a full-featured and
fully dedicated&amp;specialized media player. This is, however, not a
goal of Pale Moon because of the inherent shift of focus from document
content to media content. That being said, the Web has shifted to be
more visual-media heavy and as such will require a browser to at least
to some extent take on the media player role.<br>
      <br>
It will never be our goal to equal or surpass dedicated media software,
since Pale Moon is and remains above all a web browser. Full-HD
streaming will be possible with the right hardware, but may not be as
smooth or as feature-rich
as what you may find in home cinema software. Also, see above, we do
not intend to have DRM in Pale Moon's core program, unlike other
applications that build on UXP, and the browser will as such remain
properly DRM-free.<br>
      <h3> Platform (operating system) support </h3>
Pale Moon is originally a Microsoft Windows product.<br>
On the roadmap are the following specific platforms to support in
addition to Windows:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Linux (x86 and x64) -- Completed and actively maintained. </li>
        <li>Mac OS X -- Unofficial support only at this time due to
unreliability of community developers for Mac. We depend entirely on
someone to step up and lead this effort long-term if it is ever going
to reach official status.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Android ARM -- <span style="font-style: italic;">Discontinued</span>.
There are no plans to make a UXP-based Android browser available; in
fact, all Android support will eventualy be removed from the platform.</li>
        <li>Linux ARM -- Depends on independent developers. Currently
experimental.<br>
        </li>
        <li>*BSD: Due to resistance from the BSD community to adhere to
normal free software development practices, we currently have no plans
to have official Pale Moon releases of any kind on the range of BSD
operating systems.</li>
        <li>Modern Solaris derivatives like Illumos -- In development.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Front-end </h3>
Pale Moon's front-end features are well-established, tried-and-tested
features that work well in terms of flexibility and customizability for
users. The front-end is and will remain XUL-based and fully extensible
by the user and browser extensions, regardless of what platform is in
use. <br>
      <h4> User Interface </h4>
The
User Interface in Pale Moon is stable, based on the Firefox 4-28
browser era UI and will not be changed in any major way as far as how
the UI operates. "Australis", the UI rework done by Mozilla in Firefox
29-56 or "Photon" as seen in Firefox 57 and later which completely
removed many customization features, will <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> be adopted. This also
means Pale Moon will retain full and ongoing support for total
restyling (complete
themes).<br>
      <h4>Developer Tools</h4>
We <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>include
Web
Developer tools in our release versions of Pale Moon. These tools are
based on the Mozilla-adaptation of Firebug, and provide a broad
set of tools for web developers and extension developers alike. Due to
the complexity of these tools and verbatim adoption of them from
Mozilla without much of our own development on them, our support for
these tools will be (very) limited and we are unlikely to implement
requests for new features in the devtools as a result. At our
discretion, we may also remove some of these tools that are considered
unnecessary or have outlived their usefulness as regards development
aids.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Plug-ins</h3>
Pale
Moon supports <span style="font-weight: bold;">NPAPI plug-ins</span>.
Unlike Firefox, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">we will not be
deprecating
or removing support for these kinds of plug-ins.</span> This means that
you
will be able to continue using your media, authentication, gaming, and
other
plug-ins in Pale Moon like Flash, Silverlight, bank-authenticators or
networking plug-ins for specific purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Extensions and extension API </h3>
Pale
Moon would not be complete without its support for browser extensions,
of course, and the extension compatibility maintained in Pale Moon is
purposefully kept at a stable level with well-established interfaces.
It
provides compatibility with most of the browser extensions originally
written for Mozilla Firefox (by accepting installations for Firefox
application IDs) even though Pale Moon is a
different application altogether from an extension point of view.
Extension developers are encouraged to make what few changes are
necessary for native Pale Moon compatibility and leverage our add-ons
website panel ("Phoebus") to publish and update
extensions.<br>
      <br>
The future of Pale Moon is to maintain this general level of
compatibility with
traditional (XUL) Firefox-targeted extensions (called "Legacy" by
Mozilla), although the
(transitional)
dual-ID setup will eventually be removed, at which point only Pale Moon
targeted extensions will be accepted. This will still allow developers
to target both Pale Moon and (legacy) Firefox with specific code for
them in a
single package, but Firefox-only extensions will no longer be
accepted
by the browser when this lands.<br>
      <br>
Pale Moon has been fitted with an indicator in the add-on manager
to make users aware which add-ons are native to Pale Moon and which are
running as "Firefox compatible", to assist in troubleshooting.<br>
      <h4> XUL extensions </h4>
This kind of extension uses the time-tested native extension
capabilities to the browser XUL (UI markup) code, combined with
JavaScript. <span style="font-weight: bold;">XUL extensions are
strongly preferred because they are independent of browser-included
libraries that may change over time.</span>
With Pale Moon aiming to keep approximate front-end compatibility with
v24 of Firefox, this is the API level that should be aimed for. <br>
      <br>
Version 28 of the browser
may need some changes to cater to some changed toolkit APIs, but in
general the UXP platform is largely compatible with the ESR52 branch of
Mozilla, from an extension point of view.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Binary components in extensions</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unlike Firefox, Pale Moon will
continue to offer full support for XUL
and XPCOM binary-component extensions and there is no plan to discard
the
current extension system</span> in lieu of Chrome-like alternatives
(WebExtensions). <br>
Mozilla has marked XUL extensions and bootstrapped extensions
as "legacy" and phased out support for all but WebExtensions,
which will affect
many Firefox extensions. We have no plans to do this and many "legacy"
Firefox extensions will continue to be possible on Pale Moon when
targeting it.<br>
      <h4> JetPack (Add-on SDK) extensions </h4>
With Pale Moon v28, <span style="font-weight: bold;">these extensions
are used at your own risk and come without our support</span>.<br>
Although we do not impose any restrictions on installing these
extensions in the current milestone, they may or may not work due to
the fact that Jetpack is in many respects tied to the Australis UI that
we do not carry. We have some compatibility libraries in place that
covers most Jetpack extension use, but you will be mostly on your own
in terms of troubleshooting and fixing interoperation bugs. Only <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">jpm</span>-based SDK
extensions are supported.<br>
      <h4>WebExtensions</h4>
      <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">We will not be supporting
WebExtensions of any kind in Pale Moon.</span> Our
current extension technologies provide all the features, functionality
and above all API access for any extension to do anything it has to,
including the limited subset that is offered by WebExtensions.<br>
      <h3> Bottom line </h3>
      <span class="bold">Pale Moon aims to remain what it is at its
heart: a fully customizable web browser.</span><br>
"Added tools" are nice, but may not be adopted in Pale Moon if they go
beyond what should normally be part of a web browser for general use.<br>
      <h3> Additional tools and services </h3>
      <h4>Pale Moon Sync </h4>
Pale Moon Sync is still lacking two features on the server side, which
should be addressed. The following improvements are planned, although
no date has been set for completion. Potentially, it requires hiring a
PHP web developer to add the features:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Account deletion.<br>
This would require the user's credentials (e-mail + password) to be
entered, after which the user account and associated data are removed
from the database. </li>
        <li>Password recovery.<br>
Offering a password reset option by sending an e-mail to the user
requesting this.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4> Pale Moon start page </h4>
We are partnered up with a start portal provider to improve the user
experience on the Pale Moon Start page with customizability of
shortcuts and localized content. This went live in the first quarter of
2015 and will remain the offered start page solution of choice for the
foreseeable future.<br>
