            <h1>Pale Moon future roadmap </h1>
            <h3>General Information </h3>
            The Pale Moon project is a community-driven project, and as such the
            future roadmap of the browser is determined not only by what is decided by
            the project owner and other developers, but also by the community. There
            are occasional polls and constructive discussions on the forum that
            determine the inclusion and progress of certain features in the
            browser.<br>
            <br>
            
            Pale Moon, with v25 more clearly than before, but over the preceding
            5 years as well, has been a diverging product, with increasing
            differences between it and other Mozilla browser products. This
            divergent path will remain Pale Moon's future. To quote: "Pale Moon
            is not Firefox, and will never be again."<br>
<br>
            Pale Moon will be selective in what is adopted into its core from
            its Mozilla sibling Firefox, and the current feature set is and will
            always be different as a result. Pale Moon does not aim to provide 100%
            parity with other browsers, but rather to offer a sane balance of features
            and workflow to its users now and in the future. Asking for such parity
            for specific features may bring the attention to such features and
            result in an evaluation of desirability based on the many factors involved,
            but never expect that Pale Moon will implement something "just
            because such-and-such other browser has it too".<br>
            <br>
            This is a preliminary document with forward-looking statements.
            Development of a complex piece of software like the Pale Moon
            browser depends on many factors, so this roadmap should be seen as an
            indication or general direction - and a dynamic document to be updated as the need arises to change plans around.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>Core Work</h3>
            Pale Moon's core is in flux, just like the web is. With the current
            practice of a total lack of standards and everyone implementing
            things based on draft specifications and recommendations instead of
            established standards, a lot of the features in Pale Moon are
            determined on an on-demand basis: If there is enough demand for a
            certain feature or if it is considered beneficial to the browser and
            the web, it will be implemented - other features may be put on hold
            or decided against altogether.<br>
            <br>
            It is beyond the scope of this document to list planned HTML/content
            improvements in Pale Moon in detail, since many of those are small, individual
            changes and additions (even though some require a lot of work to
            implement by re-writing parts of the parser and renderer in Pale
            Moon's core).<br>
            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
            JavaScript development is currently one of the main focuses of the
            core work performed on Pale Moon, and the 25.* milestone will see
            continual added implementation of more of the ECMAScript version 6 (ES6)
            draft.
            Pale Moon currently already supports everything in the actual ES5
            standard, but is being extended to offer web developers more
            "bleeding edge" JavaScript features to work with from the ES6 draft.<br>
            <h4>Media support</h4>
            Media support is a regularly-discussed topic for Pale Moon users,
            since part of the user base would prefer a browser to also be a
            full-featured and fully dedicated&amp;specialized media player. This is, however,
            not a goal of Pale Moon because of the inherent shift of focus from
            document content to media content.<br>
            Even more so, specific websites have started implementing very
            specific delivery methods for media that should never be part of a web
            browser - demanding features specific to certain clients to off-load tasks to
            the browser. Specifically, media should be delivered in a playable
            container format, but certain streaming sites insist on trying to
            deliver their content in different ways putting unnecessary demands
            on web clients.<br>
            <br>
            As such, specific media streaming features are <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">not</span>
            on Pale Moon's roadmap:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>MSE (Media Source Extensions)</li>
              <li>DASH support through MSE</li>
              <li>In-browser DRM, either through dynamically downloaded
                closed-source components or data-mangling in JS</li>
            </ul>
            Current media support will be only extended where needed for regular data
            formats, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">already includes</span>:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>MPEG support</li>
              <li>Common streaming Open Source audio formats (ogg/vorbis/etc) </li>
              <li>H.264 on supported operating systems</li>
              <li>WebM/Theora containers</li>
              <li>VPX (VP8 and VP9) support</li>
              <li>High framerate support</li>
              <li>Full-screen HTML5 video</li>
              <li>Plugin-based video formats (Flash/Silverlight/etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            There are currently no plans to extend media support any further,
            considering the already broadly-encompassing media support in the
            web browser.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>Platform support</h3>
            Pale Moon is originally a Microsoft Windows product.<br>
            On the roadmap are the following specific platforms to support in
            addition to Windows:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Linux (x86 and x64) -- Completed and actively maintained</li>
              <li>Mac OS X -- Currently in its early stages (alpha) </li>
              <li>Android ARM -- Completed and actively maintained
                (Fennec-based) </li>
              <li>Android-x86 -- Experimental (Fennec-based), no public releases yet<br>
</li>
              <li>ReactOS -- A specific version is planned for this platform in the future<br>
</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Front-end</h3>
            Pale Moon's front-end features are well-established,
            tried-and-tested features that work well in terms of flexibility and customizability
            for users. The front-end is and will remain XUL-based and fully
            extensible by the user.<br>
            <h4>User Interface</h4>
            The User Interface in Pale Moon is stable, based on the Firefox 4-28
            browser era UI and will not be changed in any major way. "Australis", the UI rework
            done by Mozilla in Firefox 29 and later, will not be adopted.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">As a side note: A number
              of other Firefox derivatives are published that seem, at first
              glance, to also not adopt Australis, but those are using extra layers on
              top of the Australis design to revert the theme/operation (for as much as
              possible, which is not complete) to a pre-Australis way of
              working. </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">This
              is fundamentally different from Pale Moon</span><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">:
              this browser does not have any Australis "CustomizableUI" code in
              it, and does not "revert" anything with an additional layer on top of
              undesired UI code.</span><br>
            <br>
            <h3>Extensions and extension API</h3>
            Pale Moon would not be complete without its support for Mozilla code
            extensions, of course, and the extension compatibility maintained in
            Pale Moon is purposefully kept at the v24 front-end level. It
            provides compatibility with most of the browser extensions originally written
            for Mozilla Firefox (by accepting installations for Firefox
            application IDs) even though Pale Moon, from v25 onwards, is a different
            application altogether from an extension point of view.<br>
            <br>
            The future of Pale Moon is to maintain this general compatibility
            with v24 era Firefox extension capabilities, although over time some
            things may change, be added or removed, in addition to offering Pale Moon
            specific extension development in individual add-ons to allow them
            to target both Pale Moon and Firefox with specific code for them in a
            single package.<br>
            <h4>XUL extensions</h4>
This kind of extension uses the time-tested native extension
capabilities to the browser XUL (UI markup) code, combined with
JavaScript. XUL extensions are strongly preferred because they are
independent of browser-included libraries that may change over time.
With Pale Moon keeping front-end compatibility with v24 of Firefox,
this is the API level that should be aimed for. Unlike Firefox,
existing API features will not be removed, although new ones may be
added in the future to extend functionality for extensions to interact
with the core.<br>
            <br>
            One issue with Pale Moon accepting Firefox IDed XUL extensions is
            the fact that this compatibility mode does not extend beyond the
            installation manifest. This is on purpose, to not break with the
            chrome manifest specification for application targeting. XUL extensions
            will therefore have to add manifest entries for overlays, skins and
            content if they target individual applications, now and in the future. Of
            course, it would be greatly preferred if extension developers, while
            doing this, actually add full installation support for Pale Moon as
            well, targeting Pale Moon's GUID of {8de7fcbb-c55c-4fbe-bfc5-fc555c87dbc4}. <br>
            <h4>JetPack (Add-on SDK) extensions</h4>
            JetPack (add-on SDK) add-ons are discouraged for Pale Moon, because
            they inherently run into compatibility issues for multi-application
            targeting due to its divergent nature from other Mozilla
            applications.
            If you still like to develop JetPack add-ons for Pale Moon, you will
            likely have to make a completely separate extension specific for
            Pale Moon targeting. Pale Moon's browser-included add-on SDK is different
            than the one included in Mozilla Firefox, and extension code
            targeted at one version will likely not be compatible with the other.<br>
<br> For the time being, Pale Moon's add-on SDK is almost fully
equivalent to v1.14 of the Mozilla add-on SDK, and this will be kept
static for at least the near future. If the SDK develops further, it
will not be by adopting a later version of the Firefox add-on SDK,
since that SDK is focused specifically on Australis and its different
APIs, and is neither future-proof nor backwards compatible. Instead,
the included add-on SDK will be documented on the Pale Moon
developer/add-on site.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>Additional tools and services</h3>
            <h4>Pale Moon authored utilities</h4>
            Some of the tools used in conjunction with Pale Moon are due for an
            update. No solid date has been set for these improvements:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Improvement of the profile migration tool to deal with
                increasing issues with potentially installed and incompatible
                Firefox add-ons.</li>
              <li>Improvement of the web installer to offer automatic
                configuration based on a few different user templates.</li>
              <li>Potentially offering automated download and configuration of
                Pale Moon UI localization files. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Pale Moon Sync</h4>
            Pale Moon Sync is still lacking two features on the server side,
            which should be addressed. The following improvements are planned,
            although no date has been set for completion. Potentially, it requires hiring
            a PHP web developer to add the features:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Account deletion.<br>
                This would require the user's credentials (e-mail + password) to
                be entered, after which the user account and associated data are
                removed from the database.</li>
              <li>Password recovery.<br>
                Offering a password reset option by sending an e-mail to the
                user requesting this.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Pale Moon start page</h4>
            We are currently working with a start portal provider to improve
            the user experience on the Pale Moon Start page with customizability
            of shortcuts and localized content. This is planned to go live in the
            first quarter of 2015.<br>
            <h4>Pale Moon add-on site services</h4>
            <p>The <a href="http://addons.palemoon.org/" target="_blank">Pale Moon add-on site</a> is a very new service of the Pale Moon
              project. It came about when the decision was made to clearly separate
              ourselves from Mozilla, although the possibility of an independent add-ons
              site was already being considered before that point in time.</p>
            <p>The add-on site has its own specific roadmap, which has two
              (planned) generations.</p>
            <p>The <strong>first generation</strong> of the add-on site has
              three stages of development and uses off the shelf tools and
              readily available knowledge and experience to provide a growing
              feature set and service very quickly. This incarnation is managed
              wholly by the "Pale Moon Add-ons Team" and administrated by Matt
              A. Tobin with resources donated to the project by Binary Outcast.
              Add-on developers will not have direct access to publishing tools
              in this generation of the site. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Phase 1 - Launch (completed)
                <ul>
                  <li>Design the base web interface and select the site
                    framework</li>
                  <li>Collect add-on information from the Pale Moon 25+
                    compatibility reports (semi-perpetual)</li>
                  <li>Document said information</li>
                  <li>Add-on Manager site integration and pass-through to AMO</li>
                  <li>Create temporary (Pseudo-Static) versions for most
                    commonly used add-ons (This is a perpetual item)</li>
                  <li>Contact add-on developers with requests for direct support
                    for Pale Moon (This is a perpetual item)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Phase 2 - Improvements (in progress)
                <ul>
                  <li>Determine final status of those add-ons that are made
                    Pseudo-Static</li>
                  <li>Provide forks where needed and populate the listing of
                    externals (those add-ons that do work and are on AMO)</li>
                  <li>Improve the user experience of add-on pages and secondary
                    pages</li>
                  <li>Assemble a team to increase productivity of the service</li>
                  <li>Provide our own services through add-on manager
                    integration and reduce 1:1 pass-through
                    <ul>
                      <li>Provide our own updates as well as updates through AMO</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Continue
                    aforementioned contact with extension developers, including
                    (where possible) working with them to fix up their extensions</li>
                  <li>Create and review policies for add-ons created/forked by the
                    Add-ons Team and those created by the community specifically for Pale Moon.</li>
                  <li>Provide an ancillary site for add-on developers with vital
                    information and documentation
                    <ul>
                      <li>Including retrieving documentation obfuscated by
                        Mozilla</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Phase 3 - Finalization and Long Term Maintenance (future)
                <ul>
                  <li>To be determined</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <strong>second generation</strong> add-on site will be one
              that has been created from the ground up to serve the Pale Moon project
              and community. This incarnation will take a protracted period of time
              to materialize and planning is still in the most preliminary of
              stages.</p>
            <p>However, broad goals for the second generation site is to try and
              replicate core functionality from Mozilla's Add-on Site including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Accounting system</li>
              <li>Self-publishing and management of add-ons by add-on developers
              </li>
              <li>Proper integration of all add-on site services including those
                for the add-on manager</li>
              <li>All features from first generation add-on site</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The add-ons site is in a state of constant refinement and
              development as such we have set up a <a href="http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=44&amp;t=6144" target="_blank">forum thread</a> and <a href="https://addons.palemoon.org/announcements/" target="_blank">page</a> for announcements and updates
              pertaining to the add-ons site.</p>
