            <h3>
              General Information
            </h3>The Pale Moon project is a community-driven project, and as such the future roadmap of the browser is
            determined not only by what is decided by the project owner and other developers, but also by the
            community. There are occasional polls and constructive discussions on the forum that determine the
            inclusion and progress of certain features in the browser.<br>
            <br>
            Pale Moon, with v25 more clearly than before, but over the preceding 5 years as well, has been a diverging
            product, with increasing differences between it and other Mozilla-based browser products. This divergent path
            will remain Pale Moon's future. To quote: "Pale Moon is not Firefox, and will never be again."<br>
            <br>
Pale Moon will be selective in what is adopted into its core from its
Mozilla sibling Firefox or written to implement features, and the
current feature set is and will always be different as a result. Pale
Moon does not aim to provide 100% parity with other browsers, but
rather to offer a sane balance of features and workflow to its users
now and in the future. Asking for such parity for specific features may
bring the attention to such features and result in an evaluation of
desirability based on the many factors involved, but never expect that
Pale Moon will implement something "just because such-and-such other
browser has it too".<br>
            <br>
            This is a preliminary document with forward-looking statements. Development of a complex piece of software
            like the Pale Moon browser depends on many factors, so this roadmap should be seen as an indication or
            general direction - and a dynamic document to be updated as the need arises to change plans around.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>
              Core Work
            </h3>Pale Moon's core is in flux, just like the web is. With the current practice of a total lack of
            standards and everyone implementing things based on draft specifications and recommendations instead of
            established standards, a lot of the features in Pale Moon are determined on an on-demand basis: If there is
            enough demand for a certain feature or if it is considered beneficial to the browser and the web, it will
            be implemented - other features may be put on hold or decided against altogether.<br>
            <br>
            It is beyond the scope of this document to list planned HTML/content improvements in Pale Moon in detail,
            since many of those are small, individual changes and additions (even though some require a lot of work to
            implement by re-writing parts of the parser and renderer in Pale Moon's core).<br>
            <h4>
              JavaScript
            </h4>JavaScript
development is currently one of the main focuses of the core work
performed on Pale Moon, and the 25.* milestone will see continual added
implementation of more of the ECMAScript version 6 (ES6) standard. Pale
Moon currently already supports everything in the actual ES5 standard,
but is being extended to offer web developers more "bleeding edge"
JavaScript features to work with from the ES6 standard. Please
understand that implementing these changes is slow and meticulous work
that requires extensive coding and testing to do properly. There is
very little margin for error, because JavaScript not only runs in
webpages in Pale Moon, but drives everything in the browser, including
many parts of the program itself.<br>
            <h4>
              Media support
            </h4>Media support is a regularly-discussed topic for Pale Moon users, since part of the user base would
            prefer a browser to also be a full-featured and fully dedicated&amp;specialized media player. This is,
            however, not a goal of Pale Moon because of the inherent shift of focus from document content to media
            content.<br>
            Even more so, specific websites have started implementing very specific delivery methods for media that
            should never be part of a web browser - demanding features specific to certain clients to off-load tasks to
            the browser. Specifically, media should be delivered in a playable container format, but certain streaming
            sites insist on trying to deliver their content in different ways putting unnecessary demands on web
            clients.<br>
            <br>
            As such, specific media streaming features are <span class="c2">not</span> on Pale Moon's roadmap:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>MSE (Media Source Extensions)
              </li>
              <li>DASH support through MSE
              </li>
              <li>In-browser DRM (EME), either through dynamically downloaded closed-source components or data-mangling in JS
              </li>
            </ul>Current media support will be only extended where needed for regular data formats, and <span class="c3">already includes</span>:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>MPEG support
              </li>
              <li>Common streaming Open Source audio formats (ogg/vorbis/etc)
              </li>
              <li>H.264 on supported operating systems
              </li>
              <li>WebM/Theora containers
              </li>
              <li>VPX (VP8 and VP9) support
              </li>
              <li>High framerate and HD resolution support (subject to hardware limitations)
              </li>
              <li>Full-screen HTML5 video
              </li>
              <li>Plugin-based video formats (Flash/Silverlight/etc.)
              </li>
            </ul>There are currently no plans to extend media support any further, considering the already
            broadly-encompassing media support in the web browser.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>
              Platform support
            </h3>Pale Moon is originally a Microsoft Windows product.<br>
            On the roadmap are the following specific platforms to support in addition to Windows:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Linux (x86 and x64) -- Completed and actively maintained
              </li>
              <li>Mac OS X -- Currently in its early stages, not maintained<br>
We can use your help on this one, since we lack hardware and expertise<br>

              </li>
              <li>Android ARM -- Completed, but not actively maintained due to lack of manpower.<br>
We can use your help on this one (Fennec-based)
              </li>
              <li>Android-x86 -- Experimental (Fennec-based), no public releases<br>
              </li>
              <li>ReactOS
-- A specific version is planned for this platform in the future, if
the platform matures enough to warrant the investment.<br>
              </li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3>
              Front-end
            </h3>Pale Moon's front-end features are well-established, tried-and-tested features that work well in terms
            of flexibility and customizability for users. The front-end is and will remain XUL-based and fully
            extensible by the user.<br>
            <h4>
              User Interface
            </h4>The
User Interface in Pale Moon is stable, based on the Firefox 4-28
browser era UI and will not be changed in any major way as far as how
the UI operates. "Australis", the UI rework done by Mozilla in Firefox
29 and later which completely removed many customization features, will
not be adopted. This also means full support for total restyling (full
themes).<br>
            <br>
            <span class="c4">As a side note: A number of other Firefox derivatives are published that seem, at first
            glance, to also not adopt Australis, but those are using extra layers on top of the Australis design to
            revert the theme/operation (for as much as possible, which is not complete) to a pre-Australis way of
            working.</span> <span class="c5">This is fundamentally different from Pale Moon</span><span class="c4">:
            this browser does not have any Australis "CustomizableUI" code in it, and does not "revert" anything with
            an additional layer on top of undesired UI code.</span><br>
            <br>
            <h3>
              Extensions and extension API
            </h3>Pale Moon would not be complete without its support for Mozilla code extensions, of course, and the
            extension compatibility maintained in Pale Moon is purposefully kept (mostly) at the Firefox v24 front-end level. It
            provides compatibility with most of the browser extensions originally written for Mozilla Firefox (by
            accepting installations for Firefox application IDs) even though Pale Moon, from v25 onwards, is a
            different application altogether from an extension point of view.<br>
            <br>
            The future of Pale Moon is to maintain this general compatibility with v24 era Firefox extension
            capabilities, although over time some things may change, be added or removed, in addition to offering Pale
            Moon specific extension development in individual add-ons to allow them to target both Pale Moon and
            Firefox with specific code for them in a single package.<br>
            <h4>
              XUL extensions
            </h4>This kind of extension uses the time-tested native extension capabilities to the browser XUL (UI
            markup) code, combined with JavaScript. XUL extensions are strongly preferred because they are independent
            of browser-included libraries that may change over time. With Pale Moon keeping front-end compatibility
            with v24 of Firefox, this is the API level that should be aimed for. Unlike Firefox, existing API features
            will not be removed, although new ones may be added in the future to extend functionality for extensions to
            interact with the core.<br>
            <br>
            One issue with Pale Moon accepting Firefox IDed XUL extensions is the fact that this compatibility mode
            does not extend beyond the installation manifest. This is on purpose, to not break with the chrome manifest
            specification for application targeting. XUL extensions will therefore have to add manifest entries for
            overlays, skins and content if they target individual applications, now and in the future. Of course, it
            would be greatly preferred if extension developers, while doing this, actually add full installation
            support for Pale Moon as well, targeting Pale Moon's GUID of {8de7fcbb-c55c-4fbe-bfc5-fc555c87dbc4}.<br>
      <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Unlike Firefox, Pale Moon will continue to offer full support for XUL
and XPCOM binary-component extensions and there is no plan to discard the
current extension system</span> for Chrome-like alternatives (WebExtensions).<br>
            <h4>
              JetPack (Add-on SDK) extensions
            </h4>JetPack (add-on SDK) add-ons are discouraged for Pale Moon, because they inherently run into
            compatibility issues for multi-application targeting due to its divergent nature from other Mozilla
            applications. If you still like to develop JetPack add-ons for Pale Moon, you will likely have to make a
            completely separate extension specific for Pale Moon targeting. Pale Moon's browser-included add-on SDK is
            different than the one included in Mozilla Firefox, and extension code targeted at one version will likely
            not be compatible with the other.<br>
            <br>
            For the time being, Pale Moon's add-on SDK is almost fully equivalent to v1.14 of the Mozilla add-on SDK,
            and this will be kept static for at least the near future. If the SDK develops further, it will not be by
            adopting a later version of the Firefox add-on SDK, since that SDK is focused specifically on Australis and
            its different APIs, and is neither future-proof nor backwards compatible. Instead, the included add-on SDK
            will be documented on the Pale Moon developer/add-on site.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>
              Additional tools and services
            </h3>
            <h4>
              Pale Moon authored utilities
            </h4>Some of the tools used in conjunction with Pale Moon are due for an update. No solid date has been set
            for these improvements:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Improvement of the profile migration tool to deal with increasing issues with potentially installed
              and incompatible Firefox add-ons.
              </li>
              <li>Improvement of the web installer to offer automatic configuration based on a few different user
              templates.
              </li>
              <li>Potentially offering automated download and configuration of Pale Moon UI localization files.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
              Pale Moon Sync
            </h4>Pale Moon Sync is still lacking two features on the server side, which should be addressed. The
            following improvements are planned, although no date has been set for completion. Potentially, it requires
            hiring a PHP web developer to add the features:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Account deletion.<br>
                This would require the user's credentials (e-mail + password) to be entered, after which the user
                account and associated data are removed from the database.
              </li>
              <li>Password recovery.<br>
                Offering a password reset option by sending an e-mail to the user requesting this.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
              Pale Moon start page
            </h4>We are partnered up with a start portal provider to improve the user experience on the Pale Moon
            Start page with customizability of shortcuts and localized content. This went live in the first
            quarter of 2015 and will likely remain the offered start page solution of choice.<br>
            <h4>
              Pale Moon add-on site services
            </h4>
            <p>
              The <a href="http://addons.palemoon.org/" target="_blank">Pale Moon add-on site</a> is a new service
              of the Pale Moon project. It came about when the decision was made to clearly separate ourselves from
              Mozilla, although the possibility of an independent add-ons site was already being considered before that
              point in time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The add-on site has its own specific roadmap, which has two (planned) generations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>first generation</strong> of the add-on site has three stages of development and uses off the
              shelf tools and readily available knowledge and experience to provide a growing feature set and service
              very quickly. This incarnation is managed wholly by the "Pale Moon Add-ons Team" and administrated by
              Matt A. Tobin with resources donated to the project by Binary Outcast. Add-on developers will not have
              direct access to publishing tools in this generation of the site.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Phase 1 - Launch (completed)
                <ul>
                  <li>Design the base web interface and select the site framework
                  </li>
                  <li>Collect add-on information from the Pale Moon 25+ compatibility reports (semi-perpetual)
                  </li>
                  <li>Document said information
                  </li>
                  <li>Add-on Manager site integration and pass-through to AMO
                  </li>
                  <li>Create temporary (Pseudo-Static) versions for most commonly used add-ons (This is a perpetual
                  item)
                  </li>
                  <li>Contact add-on developers with requests for direct support for Pale Moon (This is a perpetual
                  item)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Phase 2 - Improvements (in progress)
                <ul>
                  <li>Determine final status of those add-ons that are made Pseudo-Static
                  </li>
                  <li>Provide forks where needed and populate the listing of externals (those add-ons that do work and
                  are on AMO)
                  </li>
                  <li>Improve the user experience of add-on pages and secondary pages
                  </li>
                  <li>Assemble a team to increase productivity of the service
                  </li>
                  <li>Provide our own services through add-on manager integration and reduce 1:1 pass-through
                    <ul>
                      <li>Provide our own updates as well as updates through AMO
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Continue aforementioned contact with extension developers, including (where possible) working
                  with them to fix up their extensions
                  </li>
                  <li>Create and review policies for add-ons created/forked by the Add-ons Team and those created by
                  the community specifically for Pale Moon.
                  </li>
                  <li>Provide an ancillary site for add-on developers with vital information and documentation
                    <ul>
                      <li>Including retrieving documentation obfuscated by Mozilla
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Phase 3 - Finalization and Long Term Maintenance (future)
                <ul>
                  <li>To be determined
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The <strong>second generation</strong> add-on site will be one that has been created from the ground up
              to serve the Pale Moon project and community. This incarnation will take a protracted period of time to
              materialize and planning is still in the most preliminary of stages.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, broad goals for the second generation site is to try and replicate core functionality from
              Mozilla's Add-on Site including:
            </p>
