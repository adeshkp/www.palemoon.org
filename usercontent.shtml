              Pale Moon User Content Policy
            </h1><br>
Pale
Moon related websites may include user-submitted content, e.g. on the
forum website or the Pale Moon add-ons website. Even though we have
clear policies and terms of service/intent in place prohibiting any wilful
posting and distribution of IP-protected, malicious and/or copyrighted content
unless specifically licensed to do so, it may happen that users,
potentially out of ignorance or due to the ambiguous nature of the
source they received material from, post user content on our websites
that is undesirable, in violation of IP or Copyright, or otherwise poses a risk.<br>
      <br>
This policy is in place to clarify intent for posted content and to
provide a safe harbor for both users and operators of our web sites.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Representation and free speech</h3>
      <br>
Content submitted or posted by users (User Content) expresses solely
the opinions and viewpoints of the users who post said content, and are
in no way representing an official viewpoint or opinion of the project,
its owner, collaborators or developers.<br>
      <br>
We adhere to the principles behind free speech: no User Content should
be censored or removed unless it is considered overly offensive,
instigating or promoting strong hostility (verbal or otherwise), or in
violation of established national or international laws.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>User-contributed software</h3>Some
parts of our websites will provide access to user-contributed software.
This access may be to user-contributed builds of the browser, or may e.g. be
to user-contributed extensions to the browser. We will do our best to
provide some measure of quality assurance for this contributed software
but all of this software is ultimately provided on an "AS-IS" basis and
used solely at your own risk.<br>
We, the operators of these websites, cannot be held responsible for any
loss of data or revenue due to the use of any posted software, and
especially software contributed by our community members. The primary
contact for issues with contributed browser builds and extensions will
at all times be the user who posted such builds or extensions, and they
will be responsible for providing support, if any.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Links to malware and external sites</h3>

      <br>
Even though User Content is moderated to prevent blatant "bad links",
we cannot guarantee that links will at all times be safe to follow,
suitable for all ages or backgrounds, or that software posted or linked
to is at all times safe to use. As a visitor it is your own
responsibility to verify and be mindful of the sources used for
software and the potential risks involved in visiting external sites
through links (especially in User Content) that we have no control
over. Following such links is at all times at your own risk.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>What to do when you find your protected content on our website(s)?</h3>
      <br>
In case of the forum: please use the on-site "private message" system
to inform any of the staff members about the violation. Please include
as much relevant detail as possible when making such a report.<br>
In case of other websites: please use the available contact channels on
the relevant site to bring this issue to our attention (IRC, e-mail).<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Please note</span>: If there is
any doubt about the validity of the report or alleged infringement, we
may not act upon it unless reported by the legal owner of said content.
We will not take content down unless we have good faith belief that it
is in fact infringing the owner's rights. This to prevent spurious and
unnecessary takedowns of otherwise acceptable content for
arbitrary/personal reasons.<br>
      <br>
We generally respond quickly to any legitimate and verifiable requests
indicating protected content has been posted, by removing such content
or blocking access to it, and informing the user in question about the
issue with the content they submitted.<br>
Takedown notices are normally not required if there is a clear
violation of content owners' rights. A simple request should in about
all cases suffice to have the content removed as soon as feasible.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>If you wish to send an official DMCA Takedown notice</h3>
      <br>
If you wish to send an official DMCA Takedown notice, either due to
lack of a timely response or a negative response by staff about user
content and you wish to pursue a more strict legal route to protect
your content, then please send a DMCA Takedown notice to <a href="mailto:legal@palemoon.org">legal@palemoon.org</a>.<br>
      <br>
This notice should at all times include:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on 
behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
        <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, 
or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by
 a single notification, a representative list of such works at that 
site.</li>
        <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be
 the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access 
to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to 
permit us to locate the material.</li>
        <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to 
contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, 
and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining 
party may be contacted.</li>
        <li>A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use 
of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the 
copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
        <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and 
under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to 
act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly 
infringed.</li>
      </ul>
