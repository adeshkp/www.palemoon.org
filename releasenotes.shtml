              Pale Moon: Release notes
            </h1>
            <h3>25.7.2 (2015-10-02)</h3>This is a stability update, addressing 2 critical hangs:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a critical hang caused by recursive reloads that might happen in iframes if its hash changed.</li>
        <li>Fixed a critical hang caused by lazy-loading of stylesheets
through a specific web programming technique as advocated by Google's
PageSpeed.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>25.7.1 (2015-09-28)</h3>
This
is a security, stability and web-compatibility update. This also marks
a security update for the Android version of Pale Moon to keep users of
the otherwise currently unmaintained OS updated regarding known
security vulnerabilities.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Code cleanup: Removed the majority of remaining telemetry
code (including the data reporting back-end and health report) to
prevent a few issues with partially removed code in earlier versions.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash due to handling of bogus URIs passed to CSS style filters (e.g. whatsapp's web interface).</li>
        <li>Permitted spec-breaking syntax in Regex character classes,
allowing ranges that would be permitted per the grammar rules in the
spec but not necessarily following the syntax rules. This impacts a
good number of (also higher profile) sites that use invalid ranges in
regular expressions (e.g. Cisco's networking academy site, Yahoo
Fantasy Football).</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash due to the newly introduced WASAPI handling
of audio channel mapping that doesn't like actual surround hardware
setups (e.g. playing a video with quadraphonic audio on a 4-speaker
setup).</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where site-specific dictionary selections
would be written to content preferences without the user's action,
potentially overwriting or clearing a previously-chosen dictionary.</li>
        <li>Added support for drag and drop of local files from sources which use text/uri-lists. (Some Linux flavors/file managers)</li>
        <li>Updated libnestegg to the most current version.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where setting the location to an empty string could cause a reload loop.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the jemalloc poison address to something that is not a NOP-slide. <span class="c7">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety hazard in ConvertDialogOptions (CVE-2015-4521)</li>
        <li>Fixed a buffer overflow/crash hazard in the VertexBufferInterface::reserveVertexSpace function in libGLES in 
ANGLE (CVE-2015-7179)</li>
        <li>Fixed an overflow/crash hazard in the XULContentSinkImpl::AddText function (CVE-2015-7175)</li>
        <li>Fixed a stack buffer overread hazard in the ICC v4 profile parser (CVE-2015-4504)</li>
        <li>Fixed an HTMLVideoElement Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution 0-day vulnerability (ZDI-CAN-3176) (CVE-2015-4509)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potentially exploitable crash in nsXBLService::GetBinding</li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety hazard in nsAttrAndChildArray::GrowBy (CVE-2015-7174)</li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety hazard for callers of nsUnicodeToUTF8::GetMaxLength (CVE-2015-4522)</li>
        <li>Fixed a heap buffer overflow/crash hazard caused by invalid WebM headers (CVE-2015-4511)</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c7">DiD</span> This means that the fix is "Defense-in-Depth": It is a fix that does not
            apply to an actively exploitable vulnerability in Pale Moon, but prevents future vulnerabilities caused by
            the same code when surrounding code changes, exposing the problem.
      <h3>25.7.0 (2015-08-26)</h3>
This is a bugfix and maintenance release.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Code cleanup: Removed the (otherwise unused) visual event tracer code.</li>
        <li>Code cleanup: Removed reflow performance tracing code (telemetry).</li>
        <li>Fixed a key JavaScript bug where defining properties on an object would wipe the object.<br>
This seems to be a common issue with "modern" libraries that use
"define" instead of "change" and expecting the other properties on the
object to be retained, resulting in "x is undefined" errors all over
the place if the object is wiped.<br>
This aligns the behavior with ES6's "Validate and apply property descriptor" pseudo-function.</li>
        <li>Updated the SQLite library to 3.8.11.1.</li>
        <li>Added support for the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/matches" target="_blank">element.matches()</a> Web API function.</li>
        <li>Added support for BASE tag parsing in source view.
Previously, when viewing the source of a document, clickable links
would be incorrect if a base path was specified in the document with
this tag.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with running timers after the computer would have been put to sleep with the browser opened.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added protection against potential bugs where our SVG mPositions is out of sync with the characters in the DOM. <span class="c7">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed use-after-free vulnerability in XMLHttpRequest::Open() (CVE-2015-4492)</li>
        <li>Fixed use-after-free vulnerability in the StyleAnimationValue class (CVE-2015-4488)</li>
        <li>Fixed crash or memory corruption in nsTArray (CVE-2015-4489)</li>
        <li>Fixed crash or memory corruption in nsTSubstring::ReplacePrep (CVE-2015-4487)</li>
        <li>Fixed potential escalation of privileges or crash (out-of-bounds write) via a crafted name in MARs (x64 only) (CVE-2015-4482)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that would allow man-in-the-middle attackers to
bypass a mixed-content protection mechanism via a feed: URL in a POST
request.

(CVE-2015-4483)</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="c7"></span>
      <h3>25.6.0 (2015-07-27)</h3>
This release addresses some security issues and a range of usability improvements to the browser.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Canvas anti-fingerprinting option: Pale Moon now includes
the option to make canvas fingerprinting much more difficult. By
setting the about:config preference <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">canvas.poisondata</span>
to true, any data read back from canvas surfaces will be "poisoned"
with humanly-imperceptible data changes. By default this is off,
because it has a large performance impact on the routines reading this
data.</li>
        <li>Added a feature to allow icon fonts to be used even when
users disallow the use of document-specified fonts. This should retain
full navigation for icon-font heavy websites (no more dreaded "boxes"
with hex codes) when custom text fonts are disabled.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a feature to prevent screen savers from kicking in
when playing full-screen HTML5 video. This is currently not yet
operational on Linux because of stability issues we've run into on that
OS, but Windows should properly benefit from this change.</li>
        <li>The "autocomplete=off" parameter for signon forms is now
completely ignored by default, to keep the user in control of their
browser's behavior and allowing credentials to be saved if wished. If
you prefer the previous behavior, allowing a website to determine
whether autocomplete should be allowed or not, then change the
about:config preference <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">signon.ignoreAutocomplete</span> to false.</li>
        <li>Reinstated the packaging of pre-compiled scripts in the
browser. Hopefully this will fix the reports by some users who found
that initial start-up after installation/upgrade of the browser was
unacceptably slow. Unfortunately this means a slightly larger
download/install size as a trade-off.</li>
        <li>Added the option to use Chrome://../skin/ overrides, in
effect allowing the use of "Icon themes"; toolbar icon replacements to
customize your browser icons without the need for any CSS or full-blown
theming.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a count for the number of matches in the find bar. it
will now list the total number of matches found, and which match is the
currently highlighted one.</li>
        <li>Fixed the issue where highlighted words after finding and
highlighting them all in a page would remain highlighted when closing
the find bar.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added support for CSP 'nonce' keywords (CSP 1.1/2.0).
Please note that this is still experimental and may not work 100%
as-expected. Please report any bugs you may find.</li>
        <li>Aligned CSP more with the spec in terms of reporting and case-sensitivity of matches, and made it more app-friendly.</li>
        <li>Added -moz-os-version selectors for @media CSS queries to simplify theming on different operating systems (esp. Windows).</li>
        <li>Updated and improved several languages for the Status Bar code, and added Slovenian.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue in the internal updater window not showing proper language strings.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the unexpected use of
"backface-visibility" on non-3D transformed elements (like the body)
would break positioned elements on web pages.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed text positioning in the combobox display area when a non-default height is set for the combobox.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a crash caused by bad Opus audio encoding in media files.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash when trying to measure memory in about:memory while playing video.</li>
        <li>Fixed a rare crash in sLayersAccelerationPrefsInitialized<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed miscellaneous other crashes.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a DNS prefetching issue for the people using this feature.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with single-word searches from the address bar when a proxy is in use.</li>
        <li>Fixed a number of build issues on Linux when using system libs.</li>
        <li>Added support for link-time optimization on newer Linux compilers.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed more telemetry code (ongoing project!).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety bug due to a bad test in nsZipArchive.cpp (CVE-2015-2735).</li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety bug in nsZipArchive::BuildFileList (CVE-2015-2736).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety bug caused by an overflow in nsXMLHttpRequest::AppendToResponseText (CVE-2015-2740).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a Use After Free in CanonicalizeXPCOMParticipant (CVE-2015-2722).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed off-main-thread nsIPrincipal use of various consumers in the tree (only grab the principal when needed).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where an IPDL message was sent off the main thread.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a potentially exploitable TCPSocket crash due to a race condition.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>

              dom.ipc.plugins.enabled.npswf*.dll boolean is set to override.<br>

              longer errors the script)<br>
              </li>

              </li>
              <li>Removed quick access keys for buttons on the updater window (since it may pop up unannounced when
