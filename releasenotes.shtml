      <h1> Pale Moon: Release notes </h1>
      <h3>27.5.0 (2017-09-26)</h3>
This is a major update furthering general development of the browser.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>User interface:<br>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Added a menu option to restart the browser.</li>
          <li>Added Windows-specific CSS parameters and queries for the
use of the system accent color. Added are parameters <code>-moz-win-accentcolor</code>
and <code>-moz-win-accentcolortext</code>, and the media query <code>-moz-win-accentcolor-applies</code>
to know if Windows is actively using an accent color.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Changed Windows' browser CSS sheet ot use variables
instead
of hard-coding colors, simplifying its style and making it more
flexible. Further cleaned up the Windows 10 specific browser style.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Changed the theme on Windows 10 to use the new accent
colors and improve O.S. consistency.</li>
          <li>Fixed some general inconsistencies in the Windows theme
on all Windows operating systems.</li>
          <li>Updated Windows widgets to be able to pick up Windows 10
accent colors dynamically and have the browser 's look and feel respond
accordingly, even with automatic color changes based on desktop
wallpaper.</li>
          <li>Removed the experimental FF4 prerelease
status-in-addressbar feature because the already-crowded address bar
needs a break. This should solve some extension interop issues, theme
issues and domain highlighting issues people have reported.</li>
          <li>Cleaned up some dead code for the plugin updater that no
longer exists.</li>
          <li>Fixed a text direction issue in preferences.</li>
          <li>Fixed an issue with disabled context menu entries after
using Customize...</li>
          <li>Reorganized and cleaned up the status preferences.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Media:<br>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>MSE Media updates (ongoing). We are focusing on improving
MP4 handling.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Improved MP3 metadata parsing (e.g. incorrect duration
with embedded album cover)</li>
          <li>Fixed a number
of searching issues in MP3 files</li>
          <li>Fixed a few crashes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fixed an issue with automatically exporting bookmarks to
HTML on shutdown.</li>
        <li>Fixed a regression re: domains allowed to/blocked from
installing add-ons.</li>
        <li>Fixed several internal errors thrown in the front-end.</li>
        <li>Fixed several minor issues in the devtools.</li>
        <li>Fixed a number of minor issues in the devtools.</li>
        <li>Added a fix to prevent the home page from being loaded (and
subsequently overridden) when restoring a session.</li>
        <li>Added an option to control add-on blocklist behavior
(Options -&gt; Security)</li>
        <li>Added DOM function <code>isSameNode()</code>.</li>
        <li>Added DOM <code>onvisibilitychange</code> event.</li>
        <li>Added <code>document.scrollingelement</code> (CSSOM).</li>
        <li>Added a basic implementation of <code>Object.values</code>
and <code>Object.entries</code>
enumerator functions
(ECMA2017 draft).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added "Open in new private window" to bookmarks, feeds and
history entries.</li>
        <li>Added HTTP request method OPTIONS.</li>
        <li>Added an option to exit to a no-content page after
encountering a network or security error.<br>
This is controlled with the preference <code>browser.escape_to_blank</code>
-- when set to <code>true</code>, "Get me out of here" buttons will
load a blank page instead of the browser's home page.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added experimental Brotli accept-encoding (alternative
to gzip/deflate compressed http data
transfer). Disabled by default for now because it causes issues.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Improved the handling of several CSS selectors.</li>
        <li>Changed session storage to remember form data for https
sites by default.</li>
        <li>Added (yet another) trap prevention method to
onbeforeunload events.</li>
        <li>Fixed privacy preferences not correctly resetting all
options when choosing "Remember History"</li>
        <li>Fixed not being able to deselect loading bookmarks in the
sidebar.</li>
        <li>Limited the display of user names and hosts in the http
auth dialog to sane lengths, preventing over-sizing issues.</li>
        <li>Fixed a number of potential crash points.</li>
        <li>Improved the security of the Windows dll loader module.</li>
        <li>Reinstated "Open all in tabs" option on folders of live
bookmarks (feeds).</li>
        <li>Made URL matching more liberal in selected text to make it
easier to open stated addresses.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with Graphite font rendering where automatic
font collision fixing didn't always work.</li>
        <li>Color Management for images is now disabled by default on
Linux, due to many distributions not having a streamlined setup with
sane default ICC profiles, which makes images look worse when color
management is enabled.</li>
        <li>Tightened the update security check to prevent acceptance
of update manifests that have been intercepted/replaced through https
MitM attacks.<br>
Please be aware that https-filtering antivirus may interfere with
future application updates as a result.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the ANGLE library to broaden WebGL support and
reduce the potential of crashes (due to junk being sent to the video
driver).</li>
        <li>Added content-sniffing for WebP images (working around
CloudFront's incorrect content-type headers).</li>
        <li>Fixed a problem with some H.264 media not playing (SPS NAL).</li>
        <li>Improved timer efficiency (switch back to lower precision
when high precision is no longer needed, reducing CPU/power
consumption).</li>
        <li>Improved context search on selected text/links.</li>
        <li>Updated address bar handling with Alt or Shift modifiers,
so that "switch to tab" with a modifier can open copies of
already-opened sites.</li>
        <li>Added a fix on Linux for starting the browser from
Enlightenment.</li>
        <li>Privacy fix: Pale Moon will now clear QuotaManager storage
(asm.js
cache/IndexedDB data) as part of clearing Offline Website Data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.4.2.1 (2017-08-28)</h3>
This is an out-of-band update for the portable version of the browser
only (Windows).<br>
This fixes a few issues in the portable shell regarding backups and
settings.<br>
      <br>
To update, please follow the recommended update procedure listed on the
      <a href="palemoon-portable.shtml">Pale Moon Portable page</a>.<br>
      <h3>27.4.2 (2017-08-22)</h3>
This is a small update to address some security and stability issues.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a number of crashes.</li>
        <li>Enabled the opt-in debugging feature to log SSL keys to a
file in all builds.</li>
        <li>Added a fix for TLS 1.3 handshakes causing a browser
hangup.<br>
Handshakes should be considerably faster now and no longer
stall in the wrong circumstances.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated NSPR to 4.15.</li>
        <li>Updated NSS to 3.31.1.</li>
        <li>Fixed a DoS issue using overly long Username in URL scheme
(CVE-2017-7783)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where (cross domain) iframes could break
scope (CVE-2017-7787) </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue in WindowsDllDetourPatcher (CVE-2017-7804)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with elliptic curve addition in mixed
Jacobian-affine coordinates (CVE-2017-7781)</li>
        <li>Fixed a UAF in nsImageLoadingContent (CVE-2017-7784)</li>
        <li>Fixed a UAF in WebSockets (CVE-2017-7800)</li>
        <li>Fixed a heap-UAF in RelocateARIAOwnedIfNeeded
(CVE-2017-7809) <span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span>
(accessibility is disabled)</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span> This means that
the fix is "Defense-in-Depth": It is a fix that does not apply to a
(potentially) actively exploitable vulnerability in Pale Moon, but
prevents future vulnerabilities caused by the same code when
surrounding code changes, exposing the problem.
      <h3>27.4.1 (2017-08-03)</h3>
This is a small update to address some media and web compatibility
issues.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed an issue where media playback would not use hardware
acceleration properly when using MSE.<br>
This would cause high CPU usage and/or choppy playback for HD video on
e.g. YouTube.</li>
        <li>Fixed ES6 iterator chains to be spec-compliant.</li>
        <li>Fixed ES6 vector append calls and some related memory leaks.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a workaround to reduce the likelihood of a potential
rare (timing-critical) crash.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.4.0 (2017-07-12)</h3>
This is a major update to straighten out most of the media streaming
issues, as well as adding the necessary enhancements, bugfixes and
security fixes to the browser.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Completely re-worked the Media Source Extensions code to
make it spec compliant, and asynchronous as per specification for MSE
with MP4. This should fix playback problems on YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo
and other sites that previously had some issues. A massive thank you to
Travis for his tireless work on making this happen!<br>
Please note that MSE+WebM (disabled by default) is not using this new
code yet (planned for the next release), and as such there is a
temporary set of things to keep in mind if you don't use default
settings:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If you have previously enabled MSE+WebM, this setting
will be reset when you update to avoid conflicting settings with the
updated MSE code.</li>
          <li>We've added an extra setting in Options to disable the
updated MSE code (asynchronous use) in case you need to use WebM or are
otherwise having issues with the updated code (please let us know in
that case).</li>
          <li>Once again, the MSE+WebM and Asynchronous MSE use are
currently mutually exclusive. You can have one or the other, not both,
until we sort out the code for WebM. To enable MSE+WebM you will first
have to disable Asynchronouse MSE in settings (otherwise the WebM
setting will be greyed out and disabled).<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Added a control in options/preferences for HSTS and HPKP
usage.</li>
        <li>Changed HTML bookmark exports to write CRLF line
endings to the file on Windows.</li>
        <li>Leveraged multi-core rendering for libVPX (VP8/VP9 WebM
decoding).</li>
        <li>Fixed some issues accessing DeviantArt (useragent-sniffing).</li>
        <li>Aligned CSS <code>text-align</code> with the spec.</li>
        <li>Added a recovery module for browser initialization issues
(e.g. when using a wrong language pack).</li>
        <li>Fixed spurious console errors for XHR requests with certain
http response codes.</li>
        <li>Enabled v-sync aligned refresh for a smoother scrolling
experience.</li>
        <li>Removed support for CSS XP-theme media queries.</li>
        <li>Improved console error reporting.</li>
        <li>Fixed resetting toolbars and controls from the safe mode
dialog.</li>
        <li>Fixed bookmark recovery option from the safe mode dialog.</li>
        <li>Fixed innerText getters for display:none elements.</li>
        <li>Fixed a GL buffer crash that might occur with certain
combinations of drivers and hardware.</li>
        <li>Added some more details to about:support.</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential crash when the last audio device is
removed during playback.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash on about:support when windowless browsers are
created.</li>
        <li>Updated <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements to blank if
the actively set value doesn't match any of the options.</li>
        <li>Updated the interpretation of 2-digit years in date formats
to match other browsers:<br>
0-49 = 2000-2049, 50-99 = 1950-1999.</li>
        <li>Added "<code>q</code>" units to CSS (quarter of a
millimeter).</li>
        <li>Added <code>.origin</code> property to blobs.</li>
        <li>Fixed several minor layout issues.</li>
        <li>Fixed disabled HTML elements not producing the proper JS
events.</li>
        <li>Implemented web content handler blacklist according to the
spec, allowing more than feeds to be registered.</li>

elements.</li>
        <li>Fixed a problem with table borders being drawn uneven or
being omitted when zooming the page.</li>
        <li>Added devtools "filter URLs" option in the network panel.</li>
        <li>Added visual sorting options to the Network inspector.</li>
        <li>Added importing of login data from Chrome profiles on
Windows (Chrome has to be closed first).</li>
        <li>Added importing of tags from bookmark export files (HTML
format).</li>

compatibility (e.g. themes, language packs).</li>
      </ul>
