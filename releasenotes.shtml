      <h1>Pale Moon: Release notes</h1>
      <h3>25.1.1 (2014-11-28) Android only!</h3>This
point release for Android only addresses critical browser issues (crash
on startup) when trying to run Pale Moon on Android 5.0 (AKA Android-L
or Lollipop). No other changes involved in this release.<br>
      <h3>25.1.0 (2014-11-14)</h3>
This
is an important update after rapid development on the back-end to keep
pace with the current changes on the web and improve compatibility with
websites.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>New feature: multi-line flexbox support.<br>
Pale Moon now supports more advanced multi-line and multi-column flex
elements. This will allow websites to use these elements for easier
responsive design of web pages and ordering/layout of multiple
elements. This has been on Pale Moon's to-do list for a while but was
rather complex to tackle, hence the delay in implementation. This
should address layout issues on several recently-updated websites (e.g.
the MSN home page).</li>
        <li>New feature: added support for collapsed flex element items.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Enhanced feature: Content Security Policy (CSP)<br>
Pale Moon now fully supports the CSP 1.0 specification allowing
websites to set restrictions on content to prevent XSS (Cross-site
scripting) attacks. Previously, the implementation in Pale Moon was
partial, and did not support a number of features, resulting in some
websites not rendering properly because Pale Moon was being too strict
in enforcing the policy. This should address issues on websites
enforcing CSP (e.g. the Dropbox web interface and FaceBook galleries).</li>
        <li>New feature: added support for iframes with inline content.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the Firefox Compatibility mode version to 31.9.<br>
With the improvements in rendering and overall feature set, the Firefox
Compatibility mode (as presented in the UserAgent string) has been
bumped to prevent websites from complaining about "using a too
old/unsupported version of Firefox" (e.g. Google websites).</li>
        <li>Pale Moon no longer builds the so-called "media navigator" by default.<br>
This module provides access to the user's webcam and microphone.
Although it can be used for other purposes, in practice this is only
used for WebRTC and, in fact, its support (GetUserMedia) is often
mistaken for actually supporting WebRTC in a browser (causing errors
since Pale Moon does not support WebRTC). No longer including these
features reduces input complexity and overhead for a feature not
actively used. This also circumvents privacy concerns/confusion like
CVE-2014-1586.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Improved tab handling on lightweight themes (personas) some
more to enhance contrast on certain themes and to make the tab hover
effect slightly more distinct.</li>
        <li>Fixed oversized/blocky menu arrows on Windows 8.1 in HiDPI mode.</li>
        <li>Fixed incorrect operating system being passed on to addons.mozilla.org.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error being thrown in the error console/web console when opening a new window.</li>
        <li>Removed the NVidia 3D Vision auxiliary utility library.<br>
This library has been the likely cause for a number of crashes on NVidia cards, and is completely unnecessary for Pale Moon.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Made the installer less aggressive for file type associations, to prevent "stealing" of globally associated file types.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Android: improved restoring of session tabs.</li>
        <li>Android: added an option to automatically restore tabs.<br>
An important thing to note with this new option is the following: with
the option enabled, Pale Moon will now automatically restore tabs you
had open previously when the app gets suspended (pushed out of memory
by other apps, closed by swipe, etc.). The "quit" main menu option,
however, completely shuts down your session, unloads Pale Moon from
active memory, and tabs will not be automatically restored when you
launch Pale Moon again. This is by design. To restore tabs in that situation, use the link from the home screen.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed memory security hazards CVE-2014-1574 and CVE-2014-1575 <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Fixed CVE-2014-1581. <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Fixed bug 1069584: Bail if a cairo surface is in an invalid state. <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Made sure to initialize surfaces for draw targets. <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Fixed CVE-2014-1594: Use AsContainerLayer() in order to avoid a bad cast. <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Fixed several problems in the HTML parser. <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Improved security of XHR by filtering out types of requests that can potentially be abused. <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>25.0.2 (2014-10-24)</h3>
This is a small update to address a number of teething problems with the new milestone release.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added a "Firefox compatibility mode" selection in Options -&gt; Advanced.<br>
This mode is enabled by default (reluctantly so), because too many
websites (including some very big players who, themselves, promote an
Open Web...) still use very poor browser detection methods based on
arbitrary User Agent string comparisons, not catering to alternative
browsers, and the resulting user experience being poor (being presented
with mobile site layouts, broken pages, or even being flat-out refused
service because someone exercises freedom of choice for web browser
used). This should alleviate most, if not all, issues with browser-discriminating websites.</li>
        <li>Improved active tab display on particularly dark personas.<br>
People using "black" personas/lightweight themes should now have a lot less difficulty distinguishing the active tab.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Disabled SSL 3.0 by default (to put a muzzle on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE">POODLE</a>).<br>
Please note that this may cause issues with some poorly configured web
servers (usually ones with a hopelessly broken security setup that do
not support TLS 1.2 or secure (re)negotiation of the protocol).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed add-on update issue (that was preventing update checking through addons.palemoon.org).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the redundant redundancy in asking redundantly if the
browser would be allowed to ask to install an extension when not on
addons.mozilla.org.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the internal UA-sniffing insanity that broke devtools in a few different and colorful ways.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>25.0.1 (2014-10-15)</h3>
This is a small update to address an important Jetpack extension compatibility issue and includes a number of security fixes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Update of the add-on SDK to add missing "Pale Moon" engine entries to 
lists. This should fix extension compatibility issues for jetpack extensions that otherwise already work with the new GUID.</li>
        <li>About box release notes link corrected</li>
        <li>Fix for VP9 decoder vulnerability <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Fix for direct access to raw connection sockets in http <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Fix for unsafe conversion to JSON of data through the alarm dom element <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Update of NSS to 3.16.2.2-RTM <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>25.0.0 (2014-10-10)</h3>
Pale
Moon 25.0 is a new major release with a large number of changes. A
summary of the most important changes can be found here; for more
details about this release, please check the <a href="http://forum.palemoon.org/">forum</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        
        <li>Change of the browser's GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) to properly differentiate from Firefox.<br>The new GUID is <span style="font-weight: bold;">{8de7fcbb-c55c-4fbe-bfc5-fc555c87dbc4}</span>.</li>
        <li>Allow extensions with both Pale Moon GUID and Firefox GUID to be installed natively (dual-ID system).<br>Pale Moon GUID blocks will have preference over Firefox (compatibility) blocks.</li>
        <li>Disconnect
 of Pale Moon's "Firefox compatibility" version from Pale Moon's 
application version to maintain Firefox 24.* extension compatibility 
regardless of Pale Moon version.</li>
        <li>Disable Firefox Compatibility mode by default.<br>This means Pale Moon will no longer have a Firefox/xx.xx indicator in its UserAgent string.<br>This
 may impact some websites that check browsers by UserAgent and possibly 
warn, complain or block you. You should contact the site's owners and 
request support for Pale Moon. Pale Moon will allow you to override the 
UserAgent on a per-site basis if you absolutely <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> visit the site and 
they absolutely <span style="font-style: italic;">won't</span> cater to your freedom of browser choice.</li>
        <li>Use the alternative sync implementation on a new server.<br>Current Pale Moon sync accounts cannot be ported over, so you will have to create a new account when updating to v25.<br>The
previous server implementation has already been shut down due to
continued issues, and will be retired on the very short term to free up
infrastructure and reduce expenses. The alternative sync implementation is Sync 1.1 compatible, like before.<br>
</li>
        <li>Stop building the WebApp runtime by default.<br>The
 use of "Web Applications" started from the command-line is such a niche
 feature that it has no business being in Pale Moon's main-line builds.<br>If
 you need the WebApp runtime for your specific organization and want to 
use Pale Moon, you can build Pale Moon from source with the feature 
enabled.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stop supporting Windows XP.</span>
As mentioned a few times before, Pale Moon's support for Windows XP
(and any other NT 5.x based operating system) has now ended. An exception to
this is the specialized Atom build because of limited operating system
availability on netbooks and the like. More details on the <a href="PM_end_of_WinXP_support.shtml">dedicated page for this change</a>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>By default, do not sync add-ons.<br>Syncing
 between different devices will likely not want you to sync the add-ons 
in use. There's a reason you're using different devices, after all.</li>
        <li>Un-prefix CSS box-sizing.<br>
You can now use <span style="color: rgb(0, 64, 128);">box-sizing:border-box</span>,
  <span style="color: rgb(0, 64, 128);">box-sizing:padding-box</span>
and <span style="color: rgb(0, 64, 128);">box-sizing:content-box</span>
to switch box-sizing mode on elements using CSS.</li>
        <li>Implement image-orientation in CSS.<br>You can now use <span style="color: rgb(0, 64, 128);">image-orientation: {angle} [flip]</span> in CSS to rotate images in 90 degree steps and optionally flip them.</li>
        <li>Improve bookmark menu item-dragging.<br>Dragging
 bookmarks in the bookmarks menu is now more convenient (allow diagonal 
dragging, prevent tooltips from interfering, etc.).<br>(Fixes bugs 225434, 419911 and 555474)</li>
        <li>Move the option to "use the classic downloads window" from status bar preferences to the main options window.<br>This
 way, it's easier for people to find and it's in a much more logical 
place. The classic downloads window will not go away any time soon in 
Pale Moon.</li>
        <li>Update branding images for official/unofficial logo, and some about: pages.</li>
        <li>Add a new type of "blank new tab" page with logo-styling.<br>This logo page will be the default setting (instead of about:blank).</li>
        <li>Add Opus audio to WebM.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add VP9</span> codec to WebM on both desktop and Android/ARM.</li>
        <li>Allow absolute-in-relative positioning in table and CSS table-cell elements.</li>
        <li>Allow the user to override the use of accessibility colors in the browser with <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">browser.display.ignore_accessibility_theme</span></span></span></li>
        <li>Improve the display of tabs when lightweight themes (personas) are in use for both light and dark themes.</li>
        <li>Enable cache compression by default to more efficiently use disk cache.</li>
        <li>When shutting down the browser while you still have
downloads in progress, Pale Moon will now by default warn you that the
downloads will be cancelled.<br>
        </li>

        <li>Added language packs for Acholi, Assamese, Kashubian, Pulaar Fulfulde, Armenian, Khmer, Ligure, Mongolian, and Swahili.<br>
        </li>

</ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bug/regression fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Prevent error in removeobserver() for the padlock code when closing a window</li>
        <li>Hang fix: Release XPCOM timer immediately after firing to prevent a race condition. (CVE-2014-1553)</li>
        <li>Android &amp; any ARM processor: Always use integers for audio instead of floats.</li>
        <li>Properly apply the use of high contrast themes on Windows 8/8.1</li>
        <li>Prevent the accumulation of hidden about:blank windows in some situations.</li>
        <li>Android: prevent deadlocks due to invalidations when using plugins (Flash)</li>
        <li>Re-enable
 high-quality downscaling of particularly large images (selective HQ 
downscaling) and improve fast image scaling method (use Lanczos instead 
of Hamming)</li>
        <li>Hang/DoS fix: Avoid uninterruptable infinite loops in IonMonkey in some situations. (CVE-2014-1548)</li>
        <li>Android: improve the handling of zooming to input fields</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Properly derive/insert the host of a URL</li>
        <li>Avoid negative audio ratios (can lead to crashes) (CVE-2014-1565)</li>
        <li>Avoid some root hazards in the style parser</li>
        <li>Add is-object check to IonBuilder::makeCallHelper (CVE-2014-1562)</li>
        <li>Clear the jumplist icon cache when history is cleared (privacy fix)</li>
        <li>Crash fix on Windows (JS JIT) (CVE-2014-1554)</li>
        <li>Prevent buffer overrun in text directionality component (CVE-2014-1567)</li>
