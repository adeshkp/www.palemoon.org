              Pale Moon: Release notes
            </h1>
            <h3>25.6.0 (2015-07-27)</h3>This release addresses some security issues and a range of usability improvements to the browser.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Canvas anti-fingerprinting option: Pale Moon now includes
the option to make canvas fingerprinting much more difficult. By
setting the about:config preference <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">canvas.poisondata</span>
to true, any data read back from canvas surfaces will be "poisoned"
with humanly-imperceptible data changes. By default this is off,
because it has a large performance impact on the routines reading this
data.</li>
        <li>Added a feature to allow icon fonts to be used even when
users disallow the use of document-specified fonts. This should retain
full navigation for icon-font heavy websites (no more dreaded "boxes"
with hex codes) when custom text fonts are disabled.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a feature to prevent screen savers from kicking in
when playing full-screen HTML5 video. This is currently not yet
operational on Linux because of stability issues we've run into on that
OS, but Windows should properly benefit from this change.</li>
        <li>The "autocomplete=off" parameter for signon forms is now
completely ignored by default, to keep the user in control of their
browser's behavior and allowing credentials to be saved if wished. If
you prefer the previous behavior, allowing a website to determine
whether autocomplete should be allowed or not, then change the
about:config preference <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">signon.ignoreAutocomplete</span> to false.</li>
        <li>Reinstated the packaging of pre-compiled scripts in the
browser. Hopefully this will fix the reports by some users who found
that initial start-up after installation/upgrade of the browser was
unacceptably slow. Unfortunately this means a slightly larger
download/install size as a trade-off.</li>
        <li>Added the option to use Chrome://../skin/ overrides, in
effect allowing the use of "Icon themes"; toolbar icon replacements to
customize your browser icons without the need for any CSS or full-blown
theming.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a count for the number of matches in the find bar. it
will now list the total number of matches found, and which match is the
currently highlighted one.</li>
        <li>Fixed the issue where highlighted words after finding and
highlighting them all in a page would remain highlighted when closing
the find bar.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added support for CSP 'nonce' keywords (CSP 1.1/2.0).
Please note that this is still experimental and may not work 100%
as-expected. Please report any bugs you may find.</li>
        <li>Aligned CSP more with the spec in terms of reporting and case-sensitivity of matches, and made it more app-friendly.</li>
        <li>Added -moz-os-version selectors for @media CSS queries to simplify theming on different operating systems (esp. Windows).</li>
        <li>Updated and improved several languages for the Status Bar code, and added Slovenian.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue in the internal updater window not showing proper language strings.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the unexpected use of
"backface-visibility" on non-3D transformed elements (like the body)
would break positioned elements on web pages.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed text positioning in the combobox display area when a non-default height is set for the combobox.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a crash caused by bad Opus audio encoding in media files.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash when trying to measure memory in about:memory while playing video.</li>
        <li>Fixed a rare crash in sLayersAccelerationPrefsInitialized<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed miscellaneous other crashes.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a DNS prefetching issue for the people using this feature.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with single-word searches from the address bar when a proxy is in use.</li>
        <li>Fixed a number of build issues on Linux when using system libs.</li>
        <li>Added support for link-time optimization on newer Linux compilers.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed more telemetry code (ongoing project!).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety bug due to a bad test in nsZipArchive.cpp (CVE-2015-2735).</li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety bug in nsZipArchive::BuildFileList (CVE-2015-2736).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a memory safety bug caused by an overflow in nsXMLHttpRequest::AppendToResponseText (CVE-2015-2740).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a Use After Free in CanonicalizeXPCOMParticipant (CVE-2015-2722).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed off-main-thread nsIPrincipal use of various consumers in the tree (only grab the principal when needed).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where an IPDL message was sent off the main thread.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a potentially exploitable TCPSocket crash due to a race condition.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>

            <br>
            <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
            <ul>

              </li>
              <li>Allow plugin-specific (.dll based) OOPP overrides also for npswf. This will not be used for the
              "master switch" for OOPP and Flash will still be in the plugin container, unless a specific
              dom.ipc.plugins.enabled.npswf*.dll boolean is set to override.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Fixed a crash during WebGL Conformance Tests for undefined indices (Toady)<br>

              </li>
              <li>Reorganized the AppMenu (give equal ease for windowed and tabbed browsing, deprioritize Sync)<br>
              </li>

              </li>
              <li>Fixed the about dialog scripting for pre-release builds (includes build date now as-intended and no
              longer errors the script)<br>
              </li>
              <li>Reorganized how pushed floats are handled in layout flow<br>

                (0=off, 1=secure only, 2=secure+mixed, 3=all)<br>
                - Cleaned up CSS<br>

              <li>Added the option to load modules into a named scope (see <a href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/Pale-Moon/issues/88">issue #88</a>)<br>
              </li>
              <li>Removed quick access keys for buttons on the updater window (since it may pop up unannounced when

                and set it to your language code.<br>

              25.4.0 (2015-05-08)
            </h3><span class="c4">IMPORTANT: If you use a language pack, make sure to update it to the latest

            <br>
            This is a major update - too much has changed for this little blurb to do it justice so please see below
            for the most important changes/fixes in this release:<br>
            <br>
            <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Updated SQLite from 3.7.17 to v3.8.8.3, improving history/bookmark/etc. performance by up to 50%
              depending on operation<br>
              </li>
              <li>Added a new "mixed-mode" state for HTTPS connections. Clarified mixed-mode connections with a
              mixed-mode padlock and better tooltips.
              </li>
              <li>Added a conditional partial shading to the URL bar and made it default (shading only on secure sites,
              no red shading at all by default).<br>
              </li>
              <li>Dev: Fixed file system mode flags for *nix systems, to make executable files like scripts actually
              flagged as executable
              </li>
              <li>Added native IPv6 lookups to NSPR to solve IPv6-only and dual-stack setups in some situations<br>
              </li>
              <li>Added a pref to control the unloading of idle plugins from memory and lowered the default "idle" time
              to 60 seconds before plugins are unloaded<br>
              </li>
              <li>Fixed version strings for e.g. flash on Linux being displayed with commas instead of periods - this
              should also fix the incorrect "your plugin is vulnerable" message while being on the latest version
              </li>
              <li>Windows: Set the double-click/Ctrl+arrow word selection to <span class="c5">not</span> eat the space
              (only select the actual word)
              </li>
              <li>Android: DNS fix for VPN connections, preventing the "server not found" issues people have been
              reporting for certain VPN providers on mobile<br>
              </li>
              <li>Updated a number of trusted root certificates, and distrusted the CNNIC root certificate by popular
              demand<br>
              </li>
              <li>Linux: Worked around the slice memory allocator not being properly disabled on later GLib versions
              </li>
              <li>Android: updated the random number generator handling on later versions of Android
              </li>
              <li>Added fix to prevent spurious re-paints with plugins (performance/UX improvement)
              </li>
              <li>Removed the plugin check link from the Addons Manager, since it's no longer reliable and not
              officially available for browsers except Mozilla Firefox. (Bonus: no user profiling/tracking through
              optimizely!)
              </li>
              <li>Optimized the NSS callback for secure connections
              </li>
              <li>Updated the domains that are whitelisted for installation of extensions/themes/personas, streamlining
              the use of addons.palemoon.org<br>
              </li>
              <li>Added personas support to titlebar text (adopt the lightweight theme's coloring/shading) in custom
              titlebar mode (Pale Moon appmenu/button)
              </li>
              <li>Added display of HTTPS protocol (SSL/TLS) to the page info window (thanks Travis!)
              </li>
              <li>Improved certificate display: Removed MD5 and added SHA256 fingerprint, and made them
              selectable/copyable
              </li>
              <li>Updated classification of secure connections: Classify any encryption with less than 128 bits or
              including RC4 (if manually enabled, see previous version notes) as weak.
              </li>
              <li>Dev: Added availability of the full ciphersuite string for use in extensions to the nsISSLStatus
              interface (nsISSLStatus.cipherSuite)
              </li>
              <li>Added MAKE_UNLINKABLE to the about: page redirector and added that as default for the reader mode on
              Android
              </li>
              <li>Removed the compilation and inclusion of a one-time-use pre-compiled startup cache in omni.ja,
              reducing overall application size significantly and avoiding a number of quirks of both the build process
              and the operation of the browser
              </li>
              <li>Fixed an NVIDIA specific GLX server vendor bug for pixmap depth and fbConfig depth
              </li>
              <li>Removed most telemetry code, reducing code complexity and wasted CPU<br>
              </li>
              <li>Linux: Added OSS support (mutually exclusive with ALSA): configure with --enable-oss
              </li>
              <li>Made DNS caching a lot less aggressive to align the browser's behavior with the dynamic nature of the
              modern web.
              </li>
              <li>Removed Mozilla-specific parameters for searches. Search suggestions should now work again for Google
              searches
              </li>
              <li>Added the option to allow users to use a fixed (JSON) file-based geolocation response in favor of a

              25.3.2 (2015-04-25)
            </h3>This release is an emergency update to fix crashes that started occurring because of Mozilla
            improperly signing the extensions and extension updates as offered through the Firefox Add-ons site
            addons.mozilla.org. Any improperly signed extension would not be able to be installed, and would
            immediately crash the browser.<span class="c2"><br>

              25.3.1 (2015-03-25)
            </h3>This is a security update to the browser to address a critical vulnerability found in the pwn2own
            contest. Only one vulnerability found in this contest applies to Pale Moon, which has been addressed in
            this update.<br>

            <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed security vulnerability <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0818">CVE-2015-0818</a>. This vulnerability would
              allow remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome
              privileges via vectors involving SVG hash navigation.
              </li>
              <li>Fixed IPv6 DNS resolution regression in some less common cases.

            <span class="c2">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Overhauled WebGL. It now properly supports depth textures, <a href="demo/shadowmap/" target="_blank">
                shadow mapping</a> and glow shaders.<br>
                Note that older operating systems or older/embedded video processors may be limited in their support of
                these features.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Updated the ANGLE library to a much more current version.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Removed the crash reporter code completely to improve overall browser responsiveness and
              operation.<br>
                Please note that a necessary victim of this has been the in-browser (devtools) SPS profiler because of
                its reliance on crash reporter data-gathering tools.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Removed the Mozilla Plugin Finder Service (no longer in use @Mozilla).
              </li>
              <li>Android: removed the Mozilla "product announcements" service.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Re-added control of the number of concurrent tabs to be restored from a session with <span class="c6">browser.sessionstore.max_concurrent_tabs</span> (accepted values 1-10)<br>
              </li>
              <li>Significantly improved performance and accuracy of date/time/timer handling.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Significantly improved performance of the creation of DOM elements with plain text content.
              </li>
              <li>Added several significant performance optimizations for arrays and strings in javascript.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Added several code performance optimizations and bugfixes in SVG, the presentation shell, SCTP, style
              gradients and CSS parsing routines. (Thanks, Axiomatic!)
              </li>
              <li>Added an "Open link in current tab" context menu entry on links for UI consistency.
              </li>
              <li>Updated styling of the browser with personas (lightweight themes) once more to improve display in
              tabs-on-top mode, improve overall legibility of tab text, and display of inverted close buttons on some
              controls on dark personas.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Added a special case check for the Flash plugin version check on Linux failing due to commas instead
              of periods in the version string.
              </li>
              <li>Added Windows 10 compatibility in executable manifests.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Android: Fixed a crash on GL canvas surfaces.
              </li>
              <li>Fixed incorrect Sync "howto" instruction links from the Sync dialogs.
              </li>
              <li>Fixed the color of selected tabs in Linux when personas (lightweight themes) are in use that do not
              match the overall tone of the OS system theme.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where a variable in parentheses would abort Javascript parsing.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where the address bar would incorrectly be cleared.<br>

              </li>
              <li>Fixed a double-free situation when using non-default memory allocators and a 0-length XHR.

                Note: production builds of Pale Moon were never vulnerable.
              </li>
              <li>Fixed a crash using DrawTarget in the Cairo graphics library. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0824" class="ex-ref">CVE-2015-0824</a>)

              <li>Fixed potential reading of local files through manipulation of form autocomplete. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0822" class="ex-ref">CVE-2015-0822</a>)
              </li>

              more restrictive again.<br>
              </li>
            </ul><span class="c7">DiD</span> This means that the fix is "Defense-in-Depth": It is a fix that does not
            apply to an actively exploitable vulnerability in Pale Moon, but prevents future vulnerabilities caused by
            the same code when surrounding code changes, exposing the problem.<br>
