      <h3>27.8.1 (2018-03-06)</h3>
This is a small update to address some breaking issues.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Backed out the NSPR/NSS update from 27.8.0 for causing
crashes, general operational instability and handshake issues.</li>
        <li>Disabled TLS 1.3 draft support by default, because with the
NSS backout we only support an older draft right now that is no longer
current and may cause connectivity issues. You can manually re-enable
it at your own risk in <code>about:config</code> by setting <code>security.tls.version.max</code>
to <code>4</code>.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.8.0 (2018-03-02)</h3>
This is a development update with new and improved features and
bugfixes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added support for emojis on Windows systems that have
relatively poor support for them with standard font sets by including
our own font (EmojiOne based for now).</li>
        <li>Added a setting in preferences to select the use of tab
previews with Ctrl+Tab.</li>
        <li>Added Eyedropper menu entry to the AppMenu.</li>
        <li>Added a preference to control whether the text cursor
(caret) should be thicker when dealing with CJK characters or not
(default = yes).</li>
        <li>Added URL fix-ups for schemes (mis-typed "ttp://" etc.).</li>
        <li>Added support for ES6 "Symbol species".</li>
        <li>Updated our TLS 1.3 support to the latest (probably final)
draft.</li>
        <li>Fixed gap inconsistency in the tabstrip.</li>
        <li>Fixed a number of browser crashes.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash with the exponentiation operator "<strong>**</strong>"</li>
        <li>Set the performance timer granularity to 1 ms.</li>
        <li>Updated the kiss-fft library to our forked 1.4.0 version.</li>
        <li>Disabled a potentially problematic optimization on Win 8+
with high contrast themes in use.</li>
        <li>Removed the notification bar when in full screen to prevent
unwanted visible screen elements.</li>
        <li>Removed unmaintained and insecure WebRTC code - building
with WebRTC enabled is no longer an option.</li>
        <li>Removed redundant checks for "Vista or later" since that is
all we support.</li>
        <li>Added display of the http status to raw request displays.</li>
        <li>Added a workaround for cloned videos not retaining their
muted state.</li>
        <li>Added a temporary workaround to avoid crashes on trackless
media.</li>
        <li>Removed some superfluous ellipses from menu labels.</li>
        <li>Fixed undesired shrinking of line heights as a result of
setting minimum font size in preferences.</li>
        <li>Fixed some issues with setting the new tab preference
(regression).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.7.2 (2018-02-01)</h3>
This is a security and stability update.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code>
behavior to only check "success" class server responses, for web
compatibility reasons.</li>
        <li>Changed the performance timer resolution once more to a
granularity of 1 ms, after evaluating more potential ways of abusing
Spectre.<br>
This takes the most cautious approach possible lacking more information
(because apparently NDAs have been signed over this between mainstream
players), follows Safari's lead, and should make it not just infeasible
but downright impossible to use these timers for nefarious purposes in
this context.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Improved the debug-only startup cache wrapper to prevent a
rare crash. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a crash in the XML parser.</li>
        <li>Added a check for integer overflow in <code>AesTask::DoCrypto()</code>
(CVE-2018-5122) <span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed a potential race condition in the browser cache.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash in HTML media elements (CVE-2018-5102)</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash in XHR using workers.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash with some uncommon FTP operations.</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential race condition in the JAR library.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span> This means that
the fix is "Defense-in-Depth": It is a fix that does not apply to a
(potentially) actively exploitable vulnerability in Pale Moon, but
prevents future vulnerabilities caused by the same code, e.g. when
surrounding code changes, exposing the problem, or when new attack
vectors are discovered.
      <h3>27.7.1 (2018-01-18)</h3>
This is a minor emergency update to address website breakage and a
theme issue.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added support for Array.prototype[@@unscopables].<br>
Unfortunately, the addition of Javascript's ES6 Unscopables in 27.7.0
was incomplete, which caused a number of websites (e.g. Chase on-line
banking, some Russian government sites) to display blank or not
complete loading after updating to that version of the browser. This
update should fix the problem by adding the missing part of the feature.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with the default theme causing tab borders
to be drawn too thick at higher settings for visual element scaling
(125%/150%) in Windows.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.7.0 (2018-01-15)</h3>
This is a stability and bugfix release, as well as adding a number of
new features to further improve web compatibility.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Reorganized access to preferences (moved to the Tools menu
on Linux, and renamed from "Options" to "Preferences" on Windows).</li>
        <li>Renamed "Restart with add-ons disabled" to "Restart in Safe
Mode" to better reflect what it does.</li>
        <li>Worked around an issue with some improperly-encoded PNG
files not decoding after our libpng update.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue on Mac builds not properly populating the
application menu.</li>
        <li>Added "My home page" as an option for new tabs.</li>
        <li>Added an option to disable the 4th and 5th mouse buttons
(Windows).<br>
(<code>mouse.button4.enabled</code> and <code>mouse.button5.enabled</code>,
respectively)</li>
        <li>Improved the resetting of non-default profiles.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with details/summary having the incorrect
height if floated, breaking layouts.</li>
        <li>Made several more improvements to the details/summary tags
to align them with the current spec and fix some additional bugs.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Implemented support for flex/columnset contents inside
buttons to align its behavior with other browsers.<br>
(this should fix layout issues with Twitch's new web interface)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where CSS clone operations would draw a
border.</li>
        <li>Changed the way fractional border widths are rounded to
provide more natural behavior.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where number inputs would incorrectly be
flagged as read-only.</li>
        <li>Added assets for tile display in the Windows start panel.</li>
        <li>Finished sync infra swapover by adding a one-time pref
migration for server used.</li>
        <li>Improved WebAudio API: Return the connected audio node from
          <code>AudioNode.connect()</code></li>
        <li>Added support for a default playback start position in
media elements.</li>
        <li>Fixed an assert in cubeb-alsa code (Linux).</li>
        <li>Added support for media cue-change events (e.g. subtitles).</li>
        <li>Updated SQLite to 3.21.0.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash when trying to use the platform embedded.</li>
        <li>Fixed devtools (gcli) screenshots on vertical-text pages.</li>
        <li>Fixed devtools copy as cURL for POST requests.</li>
        <li>Improved the HTML editor component (several bugfixes).</li>
        <li>Added support for ES7's exponentiation <code>a ** b</code>
operator.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with arrow functions incorrectly creating an
'arguments' binding.</li>
        <li>Added Javascript's ES6 "unscopables".</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security/privacy fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Disabled automatic filling in of log-in details by default
to prevent potential risks of credentials being abused (e.g. for
tracking) or stolen.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a preference (in the category security) to easily
enable or
disable automatic filling in of log-in data.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed the sending of referrers when opening a link in a
new private window.</li>
        <li>Added an option to disable the page visibility Web API (<code>dom.visibilityAPI.enabled</code>),
allowing users to prevent pages from knowing whether they are being
actively displayed to the user or not.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed the "ask every time" policy for cookies. For
granular control, please use any of the excellent available extensions
to regulate cookie use on a per-site or per-url basis.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added support for <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code>
(for scripts).</li>
        <li>Changed the resolution of performance timers to a level
where any future potential abuse for hardware-timing attacks becomes
impractical. <span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);"></span>
      <h3>27.6.2 (2017-11-28)</h3>
This is a security and minor bugfix update to the browser.<br>
This will most likely be the last update for 2017, with the holidays
not far away.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented the concept of so-called "cookie-averse
document objects" which is a security&amp;privacy measure that blocks
certain web content from setting cookies. This mitigates
cookie-injection, which might help against "hidden" cookie tracking.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Mitigated some domain name spoofing through IDN by using
dotless-i and dotless-j with accents. (CVE-2017-7832)<br>
Pale Moon will display these kinds of spoofed domains in punycode now
in the actual address bar.<br>
Please note that the <a
 href="https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=15583"
 target="_blank">identity panel</a> will always be able to help you on
secure sites when IDNs are in use to notice potential spoofing, as
opposed to relying on detection algorithms in the URL itself. As such,
some other issues like CVE-2017-7833 are already mitigated by us.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with mixed-content blocking. (CVE-2017-7835)</li>
        <li>Added an extra check for the correct signature data type on
certificates.</li>
        <li>Added missing sanitization in exporting bookmarks to HTML.
(CVE-2017-7840)</li>
        <li>Fixed several crashes and memory safety hazards.</li>
        <li>Fixed the Linux load throbber image to be properly encoded,
to prevent flickering.</li>
        <li>Removed the shortcut key combination for restarting the
browser to avoid issues with people using certain keyboard layouts
hitting the combination and unintentionally triggering a browser
restart.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.6.1 (2017-11-15)</h3>
This is a minor bugfix release to address some pressing issues people
have reported.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a regression with new windows (opening two windows
from the command-line or file association, focus issues on new windows,
not loading the home page in a new window, etc.)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Aligned XHR with the currect spec to allow <code>withCredentials</code>.</li>
        <li>Fixed an input element focus issue within handlers.</li>
        <li>Fixed the processing of all-padding HTTP/2 frames to
prevent rare HTTP/2 hangups.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated CitiBank override to work around their login issues.</li>
        <li>Updated Netflix override to a community-supplied one that
seems to satisfy their arbitrary restrictions better.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.6.0 (2017-11-07)</h3>
This is a major development update.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Dropped support for Direct2D 1.0 to avoid font rendering
issues. Windows installations not capable of using Direct2D 1.1 will
now fall back to software rendering. As a result, fonts may look
different from this version onwards if you are on Windows Vista or
Windows 7. Users on Windows 7 affected by this should install the <a
 href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36805"
 target="_blank">Platform Update</a> to re-enable Direct2D.</li>
        <li>Updated the Brotli decoder library, and enabled support for
Brotli HTTP content-encoding by default.</li>
        <li>Added notifications to inform users about WebExtensions not
being supported if they try to install them (as opposed to "extension
is corrupt")</li>
        <li>Added a number of DOM childNode convenience functions. This
should fix some lazy-loading frameworks.<br>
(enjoy your LOLcats again!)</li>
        <li>Changed automatic updates over to the new infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Added extra proxy settings in Options, covering DNS lookups
through SOCKS v5 and automatic proxy authentication with known
credentials.</li>
        <li>Added a selectable fallback character encoding of UTF-8 and
fallback to UTF-8 as a last effort. (Issue #1423)</li>
        <li>Improved timing of <code>canplay</code> and <code>canplaythrough</code>
firing to work around a potential race condition locking up queued
video playback.</li>
        <li>Improved upmixing of mono sound for multi-channel setups.</li>
        <li>Fixed a parallelization issue with the KISS-FFT library
causing
CPU-deadlocked threads (Issue #1425)</li>
        <li>Fixed "Remove from history" function from the downloads
panel.</li>
        <li>Forced focus on the address bar in new windows if the
content is a blank/empty document.</li>
        <li>Fixed the dropmarker in the address bar to allow the
suggestions to be closed with a click.</li>
        <li>Further cleaned up the status bar code.</li>
        <li>Disabled window.showModalDialog; it's been removed from the
spec 2 years ago and has potential abuse issues (modal dialogs block
the UI)</li>
        <li>Fixed image decoder calls to make sure the image load event
doesn't fire prematurely.</li>
        <li>Updated LibPNG to 1.6.28, and enabled faster SSE2 decoding.</li>
        <li>Updated WOFF2 code from upstream.</li>
        <li>Updated the zlib compression library.</li>
        <li>Made general improvements to internal code structure and
spec adherence.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with certain command-line parameters being
used.</li>
        <li>Updated the default theme to improve consistency and
contrast of toolbar and download buttons.</li>
        <li>Increased the default duration of notification pop-ups and
made them configurable.</li>
        <li>Improved handling of audio-visual media (ongoing).</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue in CSS where elements would sometimes reflow
to the next line even with sufficient visual space.</li>
        <li>Aligned the implementation of <code>for(let x=y;;)</code>
loops with the final ES6 specification.</li>
        <li>Fixed the selection system inside of a nested
contenteditable element being broken.</li>
        <li>Fixed Windows 10 detection for blocklisting graphics
drivers.</li>
        <li>Enabled pasting of clipboard data in documents without an
editor element to improve web compatibility.</li>
        <li>Fixed the uninstallation routine of restartless add-ons.</li>
        <li>Fixed the handling of unimplemented functions in the
console API.</li>
        <li>Updated the Facebook user-agent to enable otherwise
vendor-restricted functionality.</li>
        <li>Updated the SVG scaling cache limit to be more lenient for
larger SVG images at a small performance trade-off, working around some
sites' design issues.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security/privacy fixes:<br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>Added an option to clear Site Connectivity Data (delete
history).</li>
        <li>Removed stale entries from the HSTS preload list, and
improved generation/processing of it.</li>
        <li>Removed undesired certificate issuer organization to common
name fallback (if issuer org is empty).</li>
        <li>Added pretty-printing for ECDSA-SHA224, 256, 384 and 512
hashed certificate signatures.</li>
        <li>Worked around some more issues with broken Apple fonts.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.5.1 (2017-10-10)</h3>
This is a security and stability update to the browser, as well as
fixing some issues users have indicated.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the default Windows 10 styling when no accent color
is applied to black-on-white.</li>
        <li>Changed the theme styling on Windows 10 when the system
window frame is used (menu bar enabled) to use the window manager
background directly, preventing visual lag updating the window color
when it changes.</li>
        <li>Updated user agent overrides for DropBox, YouTube and
Yahoo to work around user agent sniffing issues.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash in the media subsystem.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a regression where video playback hardware
acceleration was disabled incorrectly on some systems.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated the hyphenation library to the latest upstream code
to fix a
security issue.</li>
        <li>Updated NSPR to 4.16-RTM with a patch to un-bust building
on win64.</li>
        <li>Updated NSS to 3.32.1-RTM.</li>
        <li>Worked around some more issues with Mac fonts
(CVE-2017-7825).</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential rooting hazard in NPAPI plugin code. <span
 style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed a potential reference issue in JavaScript arrays. <span
 style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);"></span>
      <h3>27.5.0 (2017-09-26)</h3>
This is a major update furthering general development of the browser.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>User interface:<br>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Added a menu option to restart the browser.</li>
          <li>Added Windows-specific CSS parameters and queries for the
use of the system accent color. Added are parameters <code>-moz-win-accentcolor</code>
and <code>-moz-win-accentcolortext</code>, and the media query <code>-moz-win-accentcolor-applies</code>
to know if Windows is actively using an accent color.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Changed Windows' browser CSS sheet ot use variables
instead
of hard-coding colors, simplifying its style and making it more
flexible. Further cleaned up the Windows 10 specific browser style.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Changed the theme on Windows 10 to use the new accent
colors and improve O.S. consistency.</li>
          <li>Fixed some general inconsistencies in the Windows theme
on all Windows operating systems.</li>
          <li>Updated Windows widgets to be able to pick up Windows 10
accent colors dynamically and have the browser 's look and feel respond
accordingly, even with automatic color changes based on desktop
wallpaper.</li>
          <li>Removed the experimental FF4 prerelease
status-in-addressbar feature because the already-crowded address bar
needs a break. This should solve some extension interop issues, theme
issues and domain highlighting issues people have reported.</li>
          <li>Cleaned up some dead code for the plugin updater that no
longer exists.</li>
          <li>Fixed a text direction issue in preferences.</li>
          <li>Fixed an issue with disabled context menu entries after
using Customize...</li>

          <li>MSE Media updates (ongoing). We are focusing on improving
MP4 handling.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Improved MP3 metadata parsing (e.g. incorrect duration
with embedded album cover)</li>
          <li>Fixed a number
of searching issues in MP3 files</li>
          <li>Fixed a few crashes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fixed an issue with automatically exporting bookmarks to

load a blank page instead of the browser's home page.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added experimental Brotli accept-encoding (alternative
to gzip/deflate compressed http data

Linux, due to many distributions not having a streamlined setup with
sane default ICC profiles, which makes images look worse when color
management is enabled.</li>
        <li>Tightened the update security check to prevent acceptance
of update manifests that have been intercepted/replaced through https
MitM attacks.<br>
Please be aware that https-filtering antivirus may interfere with

      <h3>27.4.0 (2017-07-12)</h3>
This is a major update to straighten out most of the media streaming
issues, as well as adding the necessary enhancements, bugfixes and
security fixes to the browser.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Completely re-worked the Media Source Extensions code to
make it spec compliant, and asynchronous as per specification for MSE
with MP4. This should fix playback problems on YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo
and other sites that previously had some issues. A massive thank you to
Travis for his tireless work on making this happen!<br>
Please note that MSE+WebM (disabled by default) is not using this new
code yet (planned for the next release), and as such there is a
temporary set of things to keep in mind if you don't use default
settings:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If you have previously enabled MSE+WebM, this setting
will be reset when you update to avoid conflicting settings with the
updated MSE code.</li>
          <li>We've added an extra setting in Options to disable the
updated MSE code (asynchronous use) in case you need to use WebM or are
otherwise having issues with the updated code (please let us know in
that case).</li>
          <li>Once again, the MSE+WebM and Asynchronous MSE use are
currently mutually exclusive. You can have one or the other, not both,
until we sort out the code for WebM. To enable MSE+WebM you will first
have to disable Asynchronouse MSE in settings (otherwise the WebM
setting will be greyed out and disabled).<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Added a control in options/preferences for HSTS and HPKP
usage.</li>
        <li>Changed HTML bookmark exports to write CRLF line
endings to the file on Windows.</li>
        <li>Leveraged multi-core rendering for libVPX (VP8/VP9 WebM
decoding).</li>
        <li>Fixed some issues accessing DeviantArt (useragent-sniffing).</li>
        <li>Aligned CSS <code>text-align</code> with the spec.</li>
        <li>Added a recovery module for browser initialization issues
(e.g. when using a wrong language pack).</li>

        <li>Updated the interpretation of 2-digit years in date formats
to match other browsers:<br>
0-49 = 2000-2049, 50-99 = 1950-1999.</li>
