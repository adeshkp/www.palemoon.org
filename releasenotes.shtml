              Pale Moon: Release notes
            </h1>
      <h3>27.0.1 (2016-11-28)</h3>This is a bugfix release for some of the issues that popped up with the new milestone.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed removal of distribution/bundles/ copies of status bar code and ruby annotations code.<br>This should clean up everything on install/upgrade that currently causes double code to create intermittent/odd behavior.</li>
        <li>Backed out some media back-end changes to fix MSE playback on Twitch.tv and other similar sites.</li>
        <li>Disabled pop-up network status in full screen by default (since video detection is rather iffy at the moment).</li>
        <li>Fixed a regression causing the "reset profile" button to not appear in about:support on the default profile.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Worked around bad Netflix interface changes - it will now use a more compatible web UI.</li>
        <li>Aligned base status bar colors with default prefs.</li>
        <li>Fixed status bar options not being remembered.</li>
        <li>Added an override for Amazon Prime videos so they won't stop us at the front door any longer.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Re-applied proper branding text to in-app licensing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>27.0.0 (2016-11-22)</h3>


      After about 8 months of development, we now have a new milestone
release with literally too many changes to list even concisely. These
release notes will therefore only highlight the most important parts of
this release.<br>
In this release we've done a full upgrade of our back-end platform,
meaning many things work different "under the hood" and you may run
into a number of extension compatibility issues as a result.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">New and updated features:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Support for DirectX 11 and Direct2d 1.1 on Windows. This
will bring Pale Moon more in line with the capabilities for current-day
operating systems and graphics hardware.</li>
        <li>Update of the Goanna engine to 3.0 - with many changes to layout and rendering for the modern web.</li>
        <li>Pale Moon now fully supports HTTP/2.</li>
        <li>Ruby Annotations are now an integral part of the HTML parser, controllable with CSS.<br>
        </li>

        <li>Media Source Extensions have been implemented to solve many video playback issues.<br>
This can be enabled/disabled and configured in Options. It's
recommended at this time to not enable MSE for WebM since there are a
few issues with it on services like YouTube (e.g. losing audio when looping/skipping).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Support for reading and playing so-called "fragmented" MP4 files has been added, further solving media playback issues.</li>
        <li>Support for SSL/TLS connections to proxy servers.<br>
        </li>

        <li>Support for the WOFF2 font format for downloadable fonts.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The
JavaScript engine has been updated with support for
many landmark ECMAScript6 features (chief among them promises and
generators). This will solve many of the web compatibility issues that
people have started to run into in the past few months (e.g. webmail
interfaces, some sites coming up blank because they are
script-generated).</li>
        <li>The way web content is cached has been changed to be more
efficient. If you want to immediately take advantage of this, clear
your cache.<br>
        </li>

        
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Removed support/features:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed support for Windows XP. If you are still running Windows XP, then your only option is to continue using Pale Moon 26.</li>
        <li>Removed the internal PDF (pre)viewer. This module was not
maintained, was unable to display even half of the PDF documents
correctly, and could not reasonably remain included in the browser.
Please use a separate reader and/or install a PDF reader plugin.</li>
        <li>Disabled building of the devtools. They will not be
included in release versions of Pale Moon from this point forward. If
you are a web developer or otherwise need those tools, fear not! They
are available as a <a href="https://addons.palemoon.org/extensions/devtools/" target="_blank">browser extension</a>.</li>
        <li>Removed the active XSS filter. This feature, although
effective, was prone to some instability and needs to be rewritten for
the update of our platform. It may or may not return in the future,
depending on whether the original author has time to rewrite parts of
this filter implementation.</li>
        <li>Removed support for Add-on SDK extensions (JetPack
extensions), considering the Mozilla/Gecko SDK is no longer compatible
with our combination of application and platform code.<br>
        </li>

      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security highlights:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>All relevant security fixes up to and including Firefox 50
have been ported across from Mozilla to continue to provide an as
secure as possible browser.</li>
        <li>Several libraries have been updated to their latest versions to pick up any important vulnerability fixes.</li>
        <li>There's a new option and control to determine whether to
save zone information (marking files as "downloaded from the Internet")
on downloaded files (Windows+NTFS). You can find this in Options.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other important notes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>When
first upgrading your browser to v27, your profile will be migrated to
the new format for the browser. This is a one-time conversion and
unfortunately this migration can cause some issues. Please see the <a href="https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=13804">forum FAQ</a> for more details.<br>
</li>
        <li>Pale Moon 27 will initially only be available in English.
We are working on getting localization done to have language packs
available over time.<br>
Important: You can not use the previous language packs since
many strings have changed. Trying to do so will likely prevent the
browser from starting or functioning. Pale Moon will automatically
disable language packs for the previous version, but if you have
explicitly disabled add-on compatibility checking you may run into
trouble.</li>

        <li>We will continue to fully support the following:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>NPAPI plugins</li>
          <li>Extensions with binary/XPCOM components</li>
          <li>XUL/Overlay and bootstrapped extensions<br>
          </li>
          <li>Complete themes</li>
          <li>Unsigned and author-signed extensions</li>
          <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_%28cipher%29">Camellia</a> encryption cipher (also in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode">GCM</a> mode)<br>
          </li>
          <li>Graphite font shaping</li>
          <li>Sync 1.1 (albeit without support for syncing add-ons)</li>
          <li>Full customization of the UI as before<br>
          </li>
        </ul>

      </ul>
