      <span style="font-weight: bold;">General note:</span><br>
      <span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span> This means that
a fix is "Defense-in-Depth": It is a fix that does not apply to a
(potentially) actively exploitable vulnerability in Pale Moon, but
prevents future vulnerabilities caused by the same code, e.g. when
surrounding code changes, exposing the problem, or when new attack
vectors are discovered.<br>

      <h3><a name="v28.8.0"></a>v28.8.0 (2019-12-10)</h3>
This is a major development release. Many things have been improved,
some landmark features have been added/enabled, and many libraries have
been updated for added stability and performance. We hope you are as
happy with this progress as we are!<br>
      <br>
All the best wishes for the Holidays to everyone!<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">New features:<br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>Added support for modern Solaris operating systems like
Illumos (thanks Athenian200!).</li>
        <li>Implemented <code>position:sticky</code> for table parts -
You can now use CSS to e.g. stick table headers so they don't scroll
off the screen!</li>
        <li>Enabled basic implementation of module type scripting.
While not fully spec compliant (yet), this will fix the few web
compatibility issues with sites that rely on this feature without
fallback (e.g. the Chromium bugtracker).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Implemented <code>Promise.prototype.finally()</code>
(ES2018).</li>
        <li>Implemented Regular Expression lookbehind (ES2018).</li>
        <li>Implemented Regular Expression /s flag (dotAll support)
(ES2018).</li>
        <li>Implemented <code>String.prototype.matchAll</code> (regex)
(ES2020).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added Ekoru to the list of default search engines. This is
a Bing-backed search engine that donates the majority of its revenue to
various charities that support the planet and animals. An
environment-supporting alternative to Ecosia if you don't want to
support Google in the process.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the way tables are rendered to fix a number of spec
compliance issues and allow relative positioning of table parts.</li>
        <li>Now building against the Windows 10 SDK 10.0.17763.132 for
increased compatibility with Windows 10 and improved Spectre mitigation.</li>
        <li>Removed the unused DiskSpaceWatcher component.</li>
        <li>Updated cairo code.</li>
        <li>Updated SQLite to 3.30.1.</li>
        <li>Updated the Brotli library to 1.0.7.</li>
        <li>Updated the woff2 library to 1.0.2.</li>
        <li>Updated the OpenType Sanitizer to 8.0.0.</li>
        <li>Updated the Javascript math library for precision and
performance fixes.</li>
        <li>Updated the embedded Emoji font to Mozilla's COLR-mapped
twemoji 0.5.0 (Twemoji 12.1.3), to support Emoji 12.</li>
        <li>Improved CSS grid rendering.</li>
        <li>Changed packaging for archives to use 7z/xz instead of
zip/bz2.</li>
        <li>Made the second argument of (DOM/CSS) <code>insertRule()</code>
optional for (Chrome) web compatibility.</li>
        <li>Removed the non-standard <code>object.prototype.watch()/unwatch()</code>
functions. Please note that this may affect some extensions; those will
need to be updated to no longer use these non-standard functions.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the status bar module to work around an issue with
relying on <code>watch()/unwatch()</code>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a build failure in the libcubeb sndio module.</li>
        <li>Fixed a small oversight in the release branch that would
potentially still mark "jnlp" (Java Web Start) files as executable.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the certificate retrieval logic in the certificate
exception dialog.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with add-ons potentially getting confused
during add-on updates due to cached scripts.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash due to unnecessary reparenting calls in
layout.</li>
        <li>Reinstated the mentioning of the number of
accelerated/total windows in Troubleshooting Information, for
completeness.</li>
        <li>Moved the embedded font for Emoji from application to
platform so all UXP applications can easily benefit from it (thanks
Tobin!).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Cleaned up the jemalloc code: Removed dead/unused code,
removed conditionals around "always on" code, and made the allocator
VLA-free.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security-related fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed the silent fallback to insecure install locations
on Windows.<br>
Pale Moon will no longer by default install into unprotected program
locations (this was a regression in v28).<br>
If your operating system account does not have the necessary
privileges, you need to manually select an accessible folder to install
into. This is important to prevent malware from modifying installed
programs in well-known but otherwise unprotected installation locations.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a preference for, and disabled, the confirmation
prompt
for URL authentication (prevents evil traps).</li>
        <li>Disabled the use of HPKP by default due to the inherent
risks involved with this feature. A preference was added to completely
disable header processing, and using preloaded pins is effectively
disabled. Please note that this is automatically disabled by default
for everyone, regardless of your previous setting for this feature, and
it is strongly recommended you keep this feature disabled. HPKP will
eventually be removed (overall Internet concensus).</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential issue when interacting with plugins. (<span
 style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span>)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential crash scenario when reading PAC
configuration. (<span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span>)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential issue with text selection painting. (<span
 style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span>)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with element references not being properly
updated. (<span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span>)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with incorrect saving of web pages as text.
(<span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span>)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a potential issue with clipboard handling. (<span
 style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span>)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential issue with attaching the debugger to web
workers. (<span style="color: rgb(191, 64, 64);">DiD</span>)</li>
        <li>Updated NSS to 3.41.4 to address CVE-2019-11756 and
CVE-2019-11745.</li>

      <h3><a name="v28.7.0"></a>v28.7.0 (2019-08-29)</h3>
This is a major development update involving a partial JavaScript
engine overhaul and improvement, implementing several website-impacting
changes. It should be noted that these changes follow some revisions of
specifications (also adopted by mainstream browsers) that are not
necessarily backwards compatible for web content as some scripting
behavior has changed. If you are targeting Pale Moon specifically (e.g.
through ua sniffing) please check and verify the behavior is still as
expected.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes/fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Landed a large JavaScript parser tune-up, which as a
targeted goal brings our ES6 stringification fully in line with the
ES2018 revision for classes, and implements rest/spread parameters for
object literals. (Cheers to Luke!)</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash with the tuned-up parser code when certain
error messages were triggered.</li>
        <li>Aligned browser behavior with mainstream regarding inner
window behavior when domain is manipulated.</li>
        <li>Improved performance dealing with frame properties.</li>
        <li>Improved performance for handling html5 strings.</li>
        <li>Improved performance of image content loading.</li>
        <li>Fixed potential type confusion in array joins.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue on some pages causing high CPU usage when
wrongly specifying plugin content.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with the add-ons manager "discover" pane if
no network connection is present.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with bookmark/history search results
offering context menu options that would be invalid without a selection.</li>
        <li>Fixed the devtools JSON viewer and enabled it by default.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed searching from <code>about:home</code> not working
for search plugins using the <code>POST</code> method.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with the checkboxes for location bar
preferences.</li>
        <li>Fixed SVG alignment issues if SVG-containing elements fall
on odd pixel sizes, causing blurry display of especially small SVGs
like icons/glyphs.<br>
SVGs will now always be pixel-snapped to provide expected crisp display.</li>
        <li>Fixed precompilation of Sync client modules when packaging.
This also removes the redundant <code>services.sync.enabled</code>
pref.</li>
        <li>Added support for matroska containers and h264-based webm
video formats.</li>
        <li>Added support for AAC audio in matroska and webm video
formats.</li>
        <li>Added support for spaces in the Mac package and application
name.</li>
        <li>Added an exception to the unique file origin policy for
font types.</li>
        <li>Added native file picker support for xdg on Linux.</li>
        <li>Updated the default bookmark icons.</li>
        <li>Updated the SQLite lib to 3.29.0.</li>
        <li>Removed e10s information from about:troubleshooting.</li>
        <li>Removed hotfix leftovers.</li>
        <li>Removed the WebIDE developer tool.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed conditional build-time disabling of the Pale Moon
status bar code.</li>
        <li>Removed "Delete this page" and "Forget about this site"
links from live bookmarks (since they make no sense on feeds).</li>
        <li>Removed the Financial Times' polyfill user-agent override
since they updated their detection to work with Pale Moon.<br>
        </li>
