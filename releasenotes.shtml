      <h1>Pale Moon: Release notes</h1>
      <h3>25.4.1 (2015-05-10)</h3>This is a small but important update to the previous major release to address some critical issues:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed loss of the browser's disk cache on startup due to incorrect corruption detection logic<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a browser crash on some HTML5 games<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>25.4.0 (2015-05-08)</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">IMPORTANT: If you use a language pack, make sure to update it to the latest version!</span>
We do have automatic updates enabled for language packs but please
double-check that the version matches. If you are using an older
language pack with this version of the browser, some dialog boxes may
come up blank.<br>
      <br>
This
is a major update - too much has changed for this little blurb to do it
justice so please see below for the most important changes/fixes in
this release:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
<li>Updated SQLite from 3.7.17 to v3.8.8.3, improving history/bookmark/etc. performance by up to 50% depending on operation<br>
</li><li>Added a new "mixed-mode" 
state for HTTPS connections. Clarified mixed-mode connections with a mixed-mode 
padlock and better tooltips.</li><li>Added
a conditional partial shading to the URL bar and made it default
(shading only on secure sites, no red shading at all by default).<br>
</li><li>Dev: Fixed file system mode flags for *nix systems, to make executable files like scripts actually flagged as executable</li><li>Added native IPv6 lookups to NSPR to solve IPv6-only and dual-stack setups in some situations<br>
</li><li>Added a pref to control the unloading of idle plugins from
memory and lowered the default "idle" time to 60 seconds before plugins
are unloaded<br>
</li><li>Fixed
 version strings for e.g. flash on Linux being displayed with commas 
instead of periods - this should also fix the incorrect "your plugin is 
vulnerable" message while being on the latest version</li><li>Windows: Set the double-click/Ctrl+arrow word selection to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> eat the space (only select the actual word)</li><li>Android:
DNS fix for VPN connections, preventing the "server not found" issues
people have been reporting for certain VPN providers on mobile<br>
</li><li>Updated a number of trusted root certificates, and distrusted the CNNIC root certificate by popular demand<br>
</li><li>Linux: Worked around the slice memory allocator not being properly disabled on later GLib versions</li><li>Android: updated the random number generator handling on later versions of Android</li><li>Added fix to prevent spurious re-paints with plugins (performance/UX improvement)</li><li>Removed
the plugin check link from the Addons Manager, since it's no longer
reliable and not officially available for browsers except Mozilla
Firefox. (Bonus: no user profiling/tracking through optimizely!)</li><li>Optimized the NSS callback for secure connections</li><li>Updated
the domains that are whitelisted for installation of
extensions/themes/personas, streamlining the use of addons.palemoon.org<br>
</li><li>Added personas support to titlebar text (adopt the lightweight
theme's coloring/shading) in custom titlebar mode (Pale Moon
appmenu/button)</li><li>Added display of HTTPS protocol (SSL/TLS) to the page info window (thanks Travis!)</li>
        <li>Improved certificate display: Removed MD5 and added SHA256 fingerprint, and made them selectable/copyable</li>
        <li>Updated
classification of secure connections: Classify any encryption with less
than 128 bits or including RC4 (if manually enabled, see previous
version notes) as weak.</li>
        <li>Dev: Added availability of
the full ciphersuite string for use in extensions to the nsISSLStatus
interface (nsISSLStatus.cipherSuite)</li>
<li>Added MAKE_UNLINKABLE to the about: page redirector and added that as default for the reader mode on Android</li><li>Removed
the compilation and inclusion of a one-time-use pre-compiled startup
cache in omni.ja, reducing overall application size significantly and
avoiding a number of quirks of both the build process and the operation
of the browser</li>
        <li>Fixed an NVIDIA specific GLX server vendor bug for pixmap depth and fbConfig depth</li>
        <li>Removed most telemetry code, reducing code complexity and wasted CPU<br>
        </li>
        <li>Linux: Added OSS support (mutually exclusive with ALSA): configure with --enable-oss</li>
        <li>Made DNS caching a lot less aggressive to align the browser's behavior with the dynamic nature of the modern web.</li>
        <li>Removed Mozilla-specific parameters for searches. 
Search suggestions should now work again for Google searches</li>
        <li>Added the option to allow users to use a fixed (JSON) file-based geolocation response in favor of a GeoIP service.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Dev:
Improvements to Clang builds (thanks Axiomatic/BitVapor!). Clang is not
currently producing stable builds on Linux, so please use GCC for that
operating system.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Linux: removed GnomeVFS that's no longer in use</li>
        <li>Fixed the "double padlock while loading a secure site" niggle in the UI</li>
        <li>Dev: added allowance of using -moz-appearance:none on
drop-down lists to hide the arrow button (catering to custom styling of
the control)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added some more ES6 math/number functions:<br><ul><li>Implemented Math.fround(x)</li><li>Implemented Number.isSafeInteger(x)</li><li>Implemented Math.clz32(x)</li></ul></li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <h3>25.3.2 (2015-04-25)</h3>
This
release is an emergency update to fix crashes that started occurring
because of Mozilla improperly signing the extensions and extension
updates as offered through the Firefox Add-ons site addons.mozilla.org.
Any improperly signed extension would not be able to be installed, and
would immediately crash the browser.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <br>
No other changes were made in this release - this is a bugfix for this particular issue only.<br>
      </span>
      <h3>25.3.1 (2015-03-25)</h3>
This
is a security update to the browser to address a critical vulnerability
found in the pwn2own contest. Only one vulnerability found in this
contest applies to Pale Moon, which has been addressed in this update.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed security vulnerability <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0818">CVE-2015-0818</a>.
This vulnerability would allow remote attackers to bypass the Same
Origin Policy and execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome
privileges via vectors involving SVG hash navigation.</li>
        <li>Fixed IPv6 DNS resolution regression in some less common cases.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>25.3.0 (2015-03-13)</h3>
This is an important update to improve features and performance, as well as address important security issues.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Overhauled WebGL. It now properly supports depth textures, <a href="demo/shadowmap/" target="_blank">shadow mapping</a> and glow shaders.<br>
Note that older operating systems or older/embedded video processors may be limited in their support of these features.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the ANGLE library to a much more current version.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed the crash reporter code completely to improve overall browser responsiveness and operation.<br>
Please note that a necessary victim of this has been the in-browser
(devtools) SPS profiler because of its reliance on crash reporter
data-gathering tools.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed the Mozilla Plugin Finder Service (no longer in use @Mozilla).</li>
        <li>Android: removed the Mozilla "product announcements" service.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Re-added control of the number of concurrent tabs to be restored from a session with <span style="color: rgb(0, 64, 128);">browser.sessionstore.max_concurrent_tabs</span> (accepted values 1-10)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Significantly improved performance and accuracy of date/time/timer handling.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Significantly improved performance of the creation of DOM elements with plain text content.</li>
        <li>Added several significant performance optimizations for arrays and strings in javascript.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added several code performance optimizations and bugfixes
in SVG, the presentation shell, SCTP, style gradients and CSS parsing
routines. (Thanks, Axiomatic!)</li>
        <li>Added an "Open link in current tab" context menu entry on links for UI consistency.</li>
        <li>Updated styling of the browser with personas (lightweight themes)
once more to improve display in tabs-on-top mode, improve overall
legibility of tab text, and display of inverted close buttons on some controls on dark personas.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a special case check for the Flash plugin version
check on Linux failing due to commas instead of periods in the version
string.</li>
        <li>Added Windows 10 compatibility in executable manifests.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Android: Fixed a crash on GL canvas surfaces.</li>
        <li>Fixed incorrect Sync "howto" instruction links from the Sync dialogs.</li>
        <li>Fixed the color of selected tabs in Linux when personas
(lightweight themes) are in use that do not match the overall tone of
the OS system theme.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where a variable in parentheses would abort Javascript parsing.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where the address bar would incorrectly be cleared.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed padding issues for dropdown lists.</li>
        <li>Fixed DNS lookups so proper record types are requested for IPv4 and IPv6.<br>
        </li>

      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Disabled all RC4-based encryption ciphers by default. <a href="https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=7466" target="_blank">[More info]</a><br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed several miscellaneous memory safety hazards.<br>
(applicable bugs related to <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0835">CVE-2015-0835</a> and <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0836">CVE-2015-0836</a>)</li>
        <li>Fixed loading of locally stored DLL files through the internal updater. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0833">CVE-2015-0833</a>)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential crash point in IndexedDB. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0831">CVE-2015-0831</a>) <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed a double-free situation when using non-default memory allocators and a 0-length XHR. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0828">CVE-2015-0828</a>)<br>
Note: production builds of Pale Moon were never vulnerable.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash using DrawTarget in the Cairo graphics library. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0824" class="ex-ref">CVE-2015-0824</a>)</li>
        <li>Fixed potential reading of local files through manipulation of form autocomplete. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0822" class="ex-ref">CVE-2015-0822</a>)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential PNG heap-overflow crash. <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Followed up on research regarding CVE-2014-8639 (see 25.2) and made cookie handling through proxies more restrictive again.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">DiD</span> This means that
the fix is "Defense-in-Depth": It is a fix that does not apply to an
actively exploitable vulnerability in Pale Moon, but prevents future
vulnerabilities caused by the same code when surrounding code changes,
exposing the problem.<br><br>
