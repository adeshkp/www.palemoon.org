      <h1>Pale Moon: Release notes</h1>
      <h3>25.3.2 (2015-04-25)</h3>This
release is an emergency update to fix crashes that started occurring
because of Mozilla improperly signing the extensions and extension
updates as offered through the Firefox Add-ons site addons.mozilla.org.
Any improperly signed extension would not be able to be installed, and
would immediately crash the browser.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <br>
No other changes were made in this release - this is a bugfix for this particular issue only.<br>
      </span>
      <h3>25.3.1 (2015-03-25)</h3>
This
is a security update to the browser to address a critical vulnerability
found in the pwn2own contest. Only one vulnerability found in this
contest applies to Pale Moon, which has been addressed in this update.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed security vulnerability <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0818">CVE-2015-0818</a>.
This vulnerability would allow remote attackers to bypass the Same
Origin Policy and execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome
privileges via vectors involving SVG hash navigation.</li>
        <li>Fixed IPv6 DNS resolution regression in some less common cases.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>25.3.0 (2015-03-13)</h3>
This is an important update to improve features and performance, as well as address important security issues.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Overhauled WebGL. It now properly supports depth textures, <a href="demo/shadowmap/" target="_blank">shadow mapping</a> and glow shaders.<br>
Note that older operating systems or older/embedded video processors may be limited in their support of these features.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the ANGLE library to a much more current version.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed the crash reporter code completely to improve overall browser responsiveness and operation.<br>
Please note that a necessary victim of this has been the in-browser
(devtools) SPS profiler because of its reliance on crash reporter
data-gathering tools.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed the Mozilla Plugin Finder Service (no longer in use @Mozilla).</li>
        <li>Android: removed the Mozilla "product announcements" service.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Re-added control of the number of concurrent tabs to be restored from a session with <span style="color: rgb(0, 64, 128);">browser.sessionstore.max_concurrent_tabs</span> (accepted values 1-10)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Significantly improved performance and accuracy of date/time/timer handling.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Significantly improved performance of the creation of DOM elements with plain text content.</li>
        <li>Added several significant performance optimizations for arrays and strings in javascript.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added several code performance optimizations and bugfixes
in SVG, the presentation shell, SCTP, style gradients and CSS parsing
routines. (Thanks, Axiomatic!)</li>
        <li>Added an "Open link in current tab" context menu entry on links for UI consistency.</li>
        <li>Updated styling of the browser with personas (lightweight themes)
once more to improve display in tabs-on-top mode, improve overall
legibility of tab text, and display of inverted close buttons on some controls on dark personas.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a special case check for the Flash plugin version
check on Linux failing due to commas instead of periods in the version
string.</li>
        <li>Added Windows 10 compatibility in executable manifests.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Android: Fixed a crash on GL canvas surfaces.</li>
        <li>Fixed incorrect Sync "howto" instruction links from the Sync dialogs.</li>
        <li>Fixed the color of selected tabs in Linux when personas
(lightweight themes) are in use that do not match the overall tone of
the OS system theme.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where a variable in parentheses would abort Javascript parsing.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where the address bar would incorrectly be cleared.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed padding issues for dropdown lists.</li>
        <li>Fixed DNS lookups so proper record types are requested for IPv4 and IPv6.<br>
        </li>

      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Security fixes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Disabled all RC4-based encryption ciphers by default. <a href="https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=7466" target="_blank">[More info]</a><br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed several miscellaneous memory safety hazards.<br>
(applicable bugs related to <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0835">CVE-2015-0835</a> and <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0836">CVE-2015-0836</a>)</li>
        <li>Fixed loading of locally stored DLL files through the internal updater. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0833">CVE-2015-0833</a>)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential crash point in IndexedDB. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0831">CVE-2015-0831</a>) <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Fixed a double-free situation when using non-default memory allocators and a 0-length XHR. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0828">CVE-2015-0828</a>)<br>
Note: production builds of Pale Moon were never vulnerable.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash using DrawTarget in the Cairo graphics library. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0824" class="ex-ref">CVE-2015-0824</a>)</li>
        <li>Fixed potential reading of local files through manipulation of form autocomplete. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0822" class="ex-ref">CVE-2015-0822</a>)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential PNG heap-overflow crash. <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">DiD</span></li>
        <li>Followed up on research regarding CVE-2014-8639 (see 25.2) and made cookie handling through proxies more restrictive again.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">DiD</span> This means that
the fix is "Defense-in-Depth": It is a fix that does not apply to an
actively exploitable vulnerability in Pale Moon, but prevents future
vulnerabilities caused by the same code when surrounding code changes,
exposing the problem.<br>
      <br>

      <h3>25.1.1 (2014-11-28) Android only!</h3>
This
point release for Android only addresses critical browser issues (crash
on startup) when trying to run Pale Moon on Android 5.0 (AKA Android-L
or Lollipop). No other changes involved in this release.<br>
      <h3>25.1.0 (2014-11-14)</h3>
This
is an important update after rapid development on the back-end to keep
pace with the current changes on the web and improve compatibility with
websites.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>New feature: multi-line flexbox support.<br>
Pale Moon now supports more advanced multi-line and multi-column flex
elements. This will allow websites to use these elements for easier
responsive design of web pages and ordering/layout of multiple
elements. This has been on Pale Moon's to-do list for a while but was
rather complex to tackle, hence the delay in implementation. This
should address layout issues on several recently-updated websites (e.g.
the MSN home page).</li>
        <li>New feature: added support for collapsed flex element items.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Enhanced feature: Content Security Policy (CSP)<br>
Pale Moon now fully supports the CSP 1.0 specification allowing
websites to set restrictions on content to prevent XSS (Cross-site
scripting) attacks. Previously, the implementation in Pale Moon was
partial, and did not support a number of features, resulting in some
websites not rendering properly because Pale Moon was being too strict
in enforcing the policy. This should address issues on websites
enforcing CSP (e.g. the Dropbox web interface and FaceBook galleries).</li>
        <li>New feature: added support for iframes with inline content.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the Firefox Compatibility mode version to 31.9.<br>
With the improvements in rendering and overall feature set, the Firefox
Compatibility mode (as presented in the UserAgent string) has been
bumped to prevent websites from complaining about "using a too
old/unsupported version of Firefox" (e.g. Google websites).</li>
        <li>Pale Moon no longer builds the so-called "media navigator" by default.<br>
This module provides access to the user's webcam and microphone.
Although it can be used for other purposes, in practice this is only
used for WebRTC and, in fact, its support (GetUserMedia) is often
mistaken for actually supporting WebRTC in a browser (causing errors
since Pale Moon does not support WebRTC). No longer including these
features reduces input complexity and overhead for a feature not
actively used. This also circumvents privacy concerns/confusion like
CVE-2014-1586.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Improved tab handling on lightweight themes (personas) some
more to enhance contrast on certain themes and to make the tab hover
effect slightly more distinct.</li>
        <li>Fixed oversized/blocky menu arrows on Windows 8.1 in HiDPI mode.</li>
        <li>Fixed incorrect operating system being passed on to addons.mozilla.org.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error being thrown in the error console/web console when opening a new window.</li>
        <li>Removed the NVidia 3D Vision auxiliary utility library.<br>
This library has been the likely cause for a number of crashes on NVidia cards, and is completely unnecessary for Pale Moon.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Made the installer less aggressive for file type associations, to prevent "stealing" of globally associated file types.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Android: improved restoring of session tabs.</li>
        <li>Android: added an option to automatically restore tabs.<br>
An important thing to note with this new option is the following: with
the option enabled, Pale Moon will now automatically restore tabs you
had open previously when the app gets suspended (pushed out of memory
by other apps, closed by swipe, etc.). The "quit" main menu option,
however, completely shuts down your session, unloads Pale Moon from
active memory, and tabs will not be automatically restored when you
launch Pale Moon again. This is by design. To restore tabs in that situation, use the link from the home screen.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed memory security hazards CVE-2014-1574 and CVE-2014-1575 <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Fixed CVE-2014-1581. <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Fixed bug 1069584: Bail if a cairo surface is in an invalid state. <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Made sure to initialize surfaces for draw targets. <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Fixed CVE-2014-1594: Use AsContainerLayer() in order to avoid a bad cast. <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Fixed several problems in the HTML parser. <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Improved security of XHR by filtering out types of requests that can potentially be abused. <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>25.0.2 (2014-10-24)</h3>
This is a small update to address a number of teething problems with the new milestone release.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added a "Firefox compatibility mode" selection in Options -&gt; Advanced.<br>
This mode is enabled by default (reluctantly so), because too many
websites (including some very big players who, themselves, promote an
Open Web...) still use very poor browser detection methods based on
arbitrary User Agent string comparisons, not catering to alternative
browsers, and the resulting user experience being poor (being presented
with mobile site layouts, broken pages, or even being flat-out refused
service because someone exercises freedom of choice for web browser
used). This should alleviate most, if not all, issues with browser-discriminating websites.</li>
        <li>Improved active tab display on particularly dark personas.<br>
People using "black" personas/lightweight themes should now have a lot less difficulty distinguishing the active tab.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Disabled SSL 3.0 by default (to put a muzzle on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE">POODLE</a>).<br>
Please note that this may cause issues with some poorly configured web
servers (usually ones with a hopelessly broken security setup that do
not support TLS 1.2 or secure (re)negotiation of the protocol).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed add-on update issue (that was preventing update checking through addons.palemoon.org).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the redundant redundancy in asking redundantly if the
browser would be allowed to ask to install an extension when not on
addons.mozilla.org.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the internal UA-sniffing insanity that broke devtools in a few different and colorful ways.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>25.0.1 (2014-10-15)</h3>
This is a small update to address an important Jetpack extension compatibility issue and includes a number of security fixes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Update of the add-on SDK to add missing "Pale Moon" engine entries to 
lists. This should fix extension compatibility issues for jetpack extensions that otherwise already work with the new GUID.</li>
        <li>About box release notes link corrected</li>
        <li>Fix for VP9 decoder vulnerability <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Fix for direct access to raw connection sockets in http <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Fix for unsafe conversion to JSON of data through the alarm dom element <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
        <li>Update of NSS to 3.16.2.2-RTM <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">security fix</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>25.0.0 (2014-10-10)</h3>
Pale
Moon 25.0 is a new major release with a large number of changes. A
summary of the most important changes can be found here; for more
details about this release, please check the <a href="http://forum.palemoon.org/">forum</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixes/changes:</span><br>
      <ul>
        
        <li>Change of the browser's GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) to properly differentiate from Firefox.<br>The new GUID is <span style="font-weight: bold;">{8de7fcbb-c55c-4fbe-bfc5-fc555c87dbc4}</span>.</li>
        <li>Allow extensions with both Pale Moon GUID and Firefox GUID to be installed natively (dual-ID system).<br>Pale Moon GUID blocks will have preference over Firefox (compatibility) blocks.</li>
        <li>Disconnect
 of Pale Moon's "Firefox compatibility" version from Pale Moon's 
application version to maintain Firefox 24.* extension compatibility 
regardless of Pale Moon version.</li>
        <li>Disable Firefox Compatibility mode by default.<br>This means Pale Moon will no longer have a Firefox/xx.xx indicator in its UserAgent string.<br>This
 may impact some websites that check browsers by UserAgent and possibly 
warn, complain or block you. You should contact the site's owners and 
request support for Pale Moon. Pale Moon will allow you to override the 
UserAgent on a per-site basis if you absolutely <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> visit the site and 
they absolutely <span style="font-style: italic;">won't</span> cater to your freedom of browser choice.</li>
        <li>Use the alternative sync implementation on a new server.<br>Current Pale Moon sync accounts cannot be ported over, so you will have to create a new account when updating to v25.<br>The
previous server implementation has already been shut down due to
continued issues, and will be retired on the very short term to free up
infrastructure and reduce expenses. The alternative sync implementation is Sync 1.1 compatible, like before.<br>
</li>
        <li>Stop building the WebApp runtime by default.<br>The
 use of "Web Applications" started from the command-line is such a niche
 feature that it has no business being in Pale Moon's main-line builds.<br>If
 you need the WebApp runtime for your specific organization and want to 
use Pale Moon, you can build Pale Moon from source with the feature 
enabled.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stop supporting Windows XP.</span>
As mentioned a few times before, Pale Moon's support for Windows XP
(and any other NT 5.x based operating system) has now ended. An exception to
this is the specialized Atom build because of limited operating system
availability on netbooks and the like. More details on the <a href="PM_end_of_WinXP_support.shtml">dedicated page for this change</a>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>By default, do not sync add-ons.<br>Syncing
 between different devices will likely not want you to sync the add-ons 
in use. There's a reason you're using different devices, after all.</li>
        <li>Un-prefix CSS box-sizing.<br>
You can now use <span style="color: rgb(0, 64, 128);">box-sizing:border-box</span>,
  <span style="color: rgb(0, 64, 128);">box-sizing:padding-box</span>
and <span style="color: rgb(0, 64, 128);">box-sizing:content-box</span>
to switch box-sizing mode on elements using CSS.</li>
        <li>Implement image-orientation in CSS.<br>You can now use <span style="color: rgb(0, 64, 128);">image-orientation: {angle} [flip]</span> in CSS to rotate images in 90 degree steps and optionally flip them.</li>
        <li>Improve bookmark menu item-dragging.<br>Dragging
 bookmarks in the bookmarks menu is now more convenient (allow diagonal 
dragging, prevent tooltips from interfering, etc.).<br>(Fixes bugs 225434, 419911 and 555474)</li>
        <li>Move the option to "use the classic downloads window" from status bar preferences to the main options window.<br>This
 way, it's easier for people to find and it's in a much more logical 
place. The classic downloads window will not go away any time soon in 
Pale Moon.</li>
        <li>Update branding images for official/unofficial logo, and some about: pages.</li>
        <li>Add a new type of "blank new tab" page with logo-styling.<br>This logo page will be the default setting (instead of about:blank).</li>
        <li>Add Opus audio to WebM.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add VP9</span> codec to WebM on both desktop and Android/ARM.</li>
        <li>Allow absolute-in-relative positioning in table and CSS table-cell elements.</li>
        <li>Allow the user to override the use of accessibility colors in the browser with <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">browser.display.ignore_accessibility_theme</span></span></span></li>
        <li>Improve the display of tabs when lightweight themes (personas) are in use for both light and dark themes.</li>
        <li>Enable cache compression by default to more efficiently use disk cache.</li>
        <li>When shutting down the browser while you still have
downloads in progress, Pale Moon will now by default warn you that the
downloads will be cancelled.<br>
        </li>

        <li>Added language packs for Acholi, Assamese, Kashubian, Pulaar Fulfulde, Armenian, Khmer, Ligure, Mongolian, and Swahili.<br>
