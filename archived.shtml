      <h1> Archived versions </h1>
This page provides access to archived versions of Pale Moon. These are
older versions of the browser that are no longer supported, but listed
here in case you want or need to use an older version. <span
 class="bold">Please be aware that these versions may have (serious)
bugs that have been fixed in later versions. We cannot reasonably
provide support for too old versions.</span><br>
      <br>
      <div class="center"> <span class="red">Please only grab the
version you personally need and do not hotlink.<br>
If you want to point people to archived versions of Pale Moon, always
link to this page, not to the links below directly.</span><br>
      </div>
      <h3> Download (all old versions) </h3>
You can download archived versions of the browser from the Pale Moon
archival FTP<br>
      <div class="center">

 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em;">Important note about
using profiles with older versions</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Please
beware:</span>
Profile migration across milestones (v26.*, v27.*, v28.*, etc.) is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">one-way</span>. This means that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">once you have upgraded your profile to a
later milestone, you can no longer safely use it in an earlier milestone</span>.
If you download an earlier milestone from this archived page you should
always start with a fresh profile or a matching backup of the profile
from the milestone you are downloading.<br>
      <br>
Profile corruption due to later milestone incompatibility of data may
not immediately be apparent, but can (and likely will) cause issues
down the line. Also, if you have upgraded a profile to a later version,
then used it with an earlier version, it should be considered corrupt
and unusable, <span style="font-weight: bold;">even in the later
version</span> (so upgrading back to a later milestone is not a fix for
this situation!).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Any</span> mixed use of the same
profile with different milestone generations of the browser is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">unsupported</span>. In case of doubt: start
with a new profile.
