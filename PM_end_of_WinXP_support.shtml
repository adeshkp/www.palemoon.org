              End of Windows XP support in Pale Moon
            </h1>Starting
with Pale Moon 25.0, support for the Windows XP operating system in
main-line builds has been dropped. This page aims to clarify the
situation and provide alternatives to current Windows XP users who wish
to continue using Pale Moon as their browser.<br>
            <br>
For the impatient: you need to use the <a href="palemoon-atom.shtml">Atom version</a>.<br>
            <h3>
              Why was Windows XP support discontinued by Pale Moon?
            </h3>Unlike Firefox, that will continue to offer Windows XP as a supported operating system in its main-line products,
            Pale Moon has discontinued support for this OS. Considering the large number of users still on Windows XP,
            this has not been done without some good reasons, outlined below:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">OS security considerations:</span> Windows XP is no longer supported or maintained by
                its developer (Microsoft) and lacks continued security updates that are needed in this day and age of
                malware. It's considered End of Life since April 2014, and using it is inherently taking a security
                risk. Also understand that Windows XP lacks some features in terms of program security and stronger
                security certificates.<br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">OS Life considerations:</span> Windows XP has the status "obsolete". It has never been
                one of Pale Moon's goals to support particularly old systems from its very inception. That includes
                obsolete operating systems.<br>
                <span class="c3"></span></li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">POSReady2009</span>: There is an alternative version of Windows XP called POSReady2009 that will receive
                continued updates beyond this point in time, but it should be noted that this is <span class="c2">not</span> a desktop operating system and has been designed specifically around use in cash
                registers and other Points of Sale situations with single-application use (and not desktop use) in
                mind. Using that alternative version is <span class="c2">never recommended for general use</span>
and is not considered by Pale Moon as a viable target operating system
to run on. Even though Microsoft will continue to provide some security
updates for specific POS applications using embedded versions of this
operating system, these updates are not necessarily compatible with
Retail/OEM installations of Windows XP. A number of people have applied
an unsactioned configuration change to their Windows XP installations
to receive these updates even though they are not meant for Windows XP.
Please understand that we cannot provide more than <a href="http://forum.palemoon.org/viewforum.php?f=53" target="_blank">self-serve community support</a> (by users for users) for either POSReady2009 or hybrid installations of POSReady updates on top of Windows XP.<br>
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="c2">Stability considerations:</span> Forcing NT 5.x kernel compatibility has shown to
                cause stability issues, especially with the optimizations used in Pale Moon's main-line builds. Being
                able to use more modern (Vista and later) windows kernel functions improves stability and overall performance
                of the browser.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Compiler support:</span> Windows XP support was only added as an afterthought to the
                compiler in use by Pale Moon (Visual Studio 2012). This support for Windows XP has never been part of
                the compiler's design and the resulting binaries in this forced compatibility are at least suboptimal
                and at most prone to severe compiler bugs and crashes.<br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Graphics subsystem compatibility:</span> Pale Moon's graphics subsystem is really
                aimed at being able to use DirectX 10 or later, something that is not available in Windows XP. Apart
                from having to build in all sorts of workarounds for DirectX 9 (the highest version supported by
                Windows XP) and the inherent problems with that, it also means that nobody on Windows XP will be able
                to benefit from the acceleration and graphics features available in later operating systems. Users on
                Windows XP are therefore already running on "extended backwards compatibility" and this part of the
                graphics subsystem is not really maintained or updated anymore.
              </li>

            <h3>
              What are my alternatives?
            </h3>There are a few alternatives to consider, and a few (although logical) things that are not
            recommended:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="c4">Recommended:</span> Of course the <span class="c2">top recommendation, if your budget
                allows for it, is to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/upgrade#T1=tab01" target="_blank">upgrade</a> to a later operating system</span>. Windows 7 is strongly recommended in
                this case for current users of Windows XP. It will be supported until 2020 and provides the most
                familiarity and customizability that Windows XP users would be looking for. On top, it is a very stable
                and well-rounded operating system. Once you have upgraded, running current and future versions of Pale
                Moon will not be an issue.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c4">Recommended:</span> Since the <a href="palemoon-atom.shtml">specialized Atom
                version</a> will continue to support Windows XP (because of the large amount of netbooks
                being limited to that operating system) you can switch to that version.
              </li>
              
              <li>Of course another alternative is to switch browser. We will be sad to see you go.<br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c5">Not recommended:</span> stay on Pale Moon 24.7.2. With the release of Pale Moon 25.0,
                simply "not upgrading the browser" is not recommended because the previous major version will not
                receive updates or further support. We simply do not have the manpower or resources to continue
                updating and maintaining multiple different versions of the same product. If you stay on Pale Moon
                24.7.2, you will not receive any security and stability updates that the current version receives, and
                you will put yourself at (even greater) risk.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="c5">Not recommended:</span> attempt to build your own from source. Building Pale Moon from
                source is not extremely difficult but it will require some advanced knowledge, since you will have to
                make edits to the source code to enable Windows XP compatibility before building. In addition, we will
                not provide any support for your own builds so you are pretty much "on your own" if you run into
                trouble.<br>
