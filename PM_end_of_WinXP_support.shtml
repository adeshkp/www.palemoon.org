      <h1>End of Windows XP support in Pale Moon</h1>With
Pale Moon 25.0, support for the Windows XP operating system has been
dropped. This page aims to clarify the situation and provide
alternatives to current Windows XP users who wish to continue using
Pale Moon as their browser.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Why was Windows XP support discontinued by Pale Moon?</h3>
Unlike its sibling Firefox, that will continue to offer Windows XP as a
supported operating system, Pale Moon has discontinued support for this
OS. Considering the large number of users still on Windows XP, this has
not been done without some good reasons, outlined below:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">OS security considerations:</span>
Windows XP is no longer supported or maintained by its developer
(Microsoft) and lacks continued security updates that are needed in
this day and age of malware. It's considered End of Life since April
2014, and using it is inherently taking a security risk. Also understand that Windows XP lacks some features in terms of program security and stronger security certificates.<br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">OS Life considerations:</span>
Windows XP has the status "obsolete". It has never been one of Pale
Moon's goals to support particularly old systems from its very
inception. That includes obsolete operating systems.<br>
          <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">There is an
alternative version of Windows XP called POSReady2009 that will receive
continued updates beyond this point in time, but it should be noted
that this is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> a desktop
operating system and has been designed specifically around use in cash
registers and other Points of Sale situations with single-application
use (and not desktop use) in mind. Using that alternative version is <span style="font-weight: bold;">never recommended for general use</span> and is not considered by Pale Moon as a viable target operating system to run on.</span><br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stability considerations:</span>
Forcing NT 5.x kernel compatibility has shown to cause stability
issues, especially with the optimizations used in Pale Moon's main-line
builds. Being able to use more modern (Vista and later) windows
functions improves stability and overall performance of the browser.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compiler support:</span>
Windows XP support was only added as an afterthought to the compiler in
use by Pale Moon (Visual Studio 2012). This support for Windows XP has
never been part of the compiler's design and the resulting binaries in
this forced compatibility are at least suboptimal and at most prone to
severe compiler bugs and crashes.<br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Graphics subsystem compatibility:</span>
Pale Moon's graphics subsystem is really aimed at being able to use
DirectX 10 or later, something that is not available in Windows XP.
Apart from having to build in all sorts of workarounds for DirectX 9
(the highest version supported by Windows XP) and the inherent problems
with that, it also means that nobody on Windows XP will be able to
benefit from the acceleration and graphics features available in later
operating systems. Users on Windows XP are therefore already running on
"extended backwards compatibility" and this part of the graphics
subsystem is not really maintained or updated anymore.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>What are my alternatives?</h3>
There are a few alternatives to consider, and a few (although logical) things that are not recommended:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Recommended:</span> Of course the <span style="font-weight: bold;">top recommendation, if your budget allows for it, is to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/upgrade#T1=tab01" target="_blank">upgrade</a> to a later operating system</span>. Windows 7
is strongly recommended in this case for current users of Windows XP.
It will be supported until 2020 and provides the most familiarity and
customizability that Windows XP users would be looking for. On top, it
is a very stable and well-rounded operating system. Once you have
upgraded, running current and future versions of Pale Moon will not be an issue.</li>
        <li><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Recommended:</span> Since the <a href="palemoon-atom.shtml">specialized Atom version</a>
will continue to support Windows XP indefinitely (because of the large amount of
netbooks being limited to that operating system) you can switch to that
version.</li>
        <li><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Recommended:</span> If you are looking for a full main-line build of Pale Moon with Windows XP support, there are also 32-bit and 64-bit <a href="http://binaryoutcast.com/software/projects/pm4xp/">alternative (third-party) builds</a>
of the browser specifically maintained for Windows XP and Server 2003
environments. Please do note that these versions will be discontinued
when the last retail NT 5.x product goes EoL in July 2015.</li>
        <li>Of course another alternative is to switch browser. We will be sad to see you go.<br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Not recommended:</span>
stay on Pale Moon 24.7.2. With the release of Pale Moon 25.0, simply
"not upgrading the browser" is not recommended because the previous
major version will not receive updates or further support. We simply do
not have the manpower or resources to continue updating and maintaining
multiple different versions of the same product. If you stay on Pale
Moon 24.7.2, you will not receive any security and stability updates
that the current version receives, and you will put yourself at (even
greater) risk.</li>
        <li><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Not recommended:</span>
attempt to build your own from source. Building Pale Moon from source
is not extremely difficult but it will require some advanced knowledge,
since you will have to make edits to the source code to enable Windows
XP compatibility before building. In addition, we will not provide any
support for your own builds so you are pretty much "on your own" if you
run into trouble.<br>
