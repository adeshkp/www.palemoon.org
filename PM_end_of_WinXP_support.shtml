with Pale Moon 27.0, we no longer support Windows XP and other Windows versions from the same era (Server 2003, etc.) in <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> of our builds.</span><br><h3>Please switch off checking for updates!</h3>No
further updates will be provided for Windows XP users. With care, you
may want to continue running Pale Moon 26.5.0 on your Windows XP
system, or switch to a different browser that still maintains support
for XP.<br>
If you choose to continue using Pale Moon, <span style="font-weight: bold;">we kindly ask that you switch off automatic updates in the browser</span>
to avoid unnecessary load on our web server and for your own safety (in
case there is a misconfiguration in the future or similar - accidents
do happen - resulting in being served an incompatible update, for
example).<br>
      <br>
Go to (Tools-&gt;)Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Update, and select "Never check for updates":<br>

      <h3>Why was Windows XP support discontinued by Pale Moon?
            </h3>
Unlike Firefox, that will (for now) continue to offer Windows XP as a supported operating system in its main-line products,
            Pale Moon has discontinued support for this OS. Considering the large number of users still on Windows XP,
            this has not been done without some good reasons, outlined below:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="c2">OS security considerations:</span> Windows XP is no longer supported or maintained by
                its developer (Microsoft) and lacks continued security updates that are needed in this day and age of
                malware. It's considered End of Life since April 2014, and using it is inherently taking a security
                risk. Also understand that Windows XP lacks some features in terms of program security and stronger
                security certificates.</li><li><span class="c2">Kernel compatibility:</span>
Windows XP is built on the NT kernel version 5. This kernel has a
significantly different architecture and set of APIs than the later
generation (NT6) that all later versions of Windows (including Windows
10) are built on. Keeping compatibility with the older generation
significantly hampers development and performance of the browser.<br>
</li>
        <li><span class="c2">Stability considerations:</span>
Forcing NT 5.x kernel compatibility has shown to cause stability
issues, especially with the optimizations used in Pale Moon. Being able
to use more modern (Vista and later) windows functions, as well as the
more native target for the Microsoft compiler in use, improves
stability. </li>

              
              <li>
                <span class="c2">Graphics subsystem compatibility:</span>
Pale Moon's graphics subsystem is aimed at being able to use DirectX 10
or later, something that is not available in Windows XP. </li>
