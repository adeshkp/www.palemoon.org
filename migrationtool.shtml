              Pale Moon profile migration tool
            </h1>This tool will help you migrate a Mozilla Firefox profile to Pale Moon.<br>
            This tool may not work for everyone, since it has a few important limitations:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>This tool only works for the default profile locations for Firefox and Pale Moon.
              </li>
              <li>This tool does not work for portable versions of either browser.
              </li>
              <li>This tool <span class="italic">may</span> not work well on limited accounts on Windows Vista.</li>
        <li>This tool is not able to migrate passwords from later
versions of Firefox to Pale Moon due to differences in password file
format.<br>
        </li>

            </ol>It was put together mainly for people who have
standard installations and as a convenient aid for people who do not
have enough knowledge of the Windows O.S. and filesystem to manually
copy the profiles over, and who would like to move history, bookmarks
and extensions across to their new browser. It is not meant to be very
versatile or flexible at this moment, but "gets the job done" in most
cases.<br>
            <br>
            Current version: <span class="bold">1.7.0</span> (2015-08-24)<br>
            This version update fixes some issues with popular add-ons and updates to the latest version of the runtime.<br>
            <br>
            <div class="c4">
              <span class="bold">Important:</span> this tool is not aware of compatibility issues with Firefox extensions
              in general, and will copy over <span class="bold">all</span> installed extensions. After migration, you
              will have to examine your installed extensions and see which ones need to be updated, reverted to an
              earlier compatible version, removed or changed out for an alternative. <span class="bold">Not all Firefox
              extensions are guaranteed to work in Pale Moon</span>, and some may even prevent proper browser operation
              if they are incompatible but still installed!<br>

            <span class="red bold">Note:</span> <span class="bold">Please close both Firefox and Pale Moon before attempting to
            migrate your profiles.</span> Not doing so may cause an incomplete transfer or give errors.<br>
