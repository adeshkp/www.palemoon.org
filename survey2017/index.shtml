      <h1>Pale Moon Survey 2017</h1>
In Feb/March 2017, we opened a usage survey for anyone to fill out,
which was a public request to users, past and present alike, to
indicate which parts of Pale Moon should have focus, and to decide in
part on development direction. This was done in the spirit of "Your
Browser, Your Way"&#8482; -- you, the user, should have a say in what your
browser will be shaped like!<br>
      <br>This
page provides an analysis of the results, and provides our (dev)
response to some of the comments our survey respondents left.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Total survey validity</h3>
      <img style="width: 276px; height: 276px;" alt="chart" src="totalvalidity.png" align="left">Despite clear indicators of what
would be considered a valid survey response, no less than 8% of the
respondents still saw it necessary to provide duplicate responses, use
anonymizers, use throwaway e-mail addresses and other behavior that
invalidated their response.<br>
      <br>
Sorry folks, but we've been very clear about this in the survey: any
responses that were either clearly made to skew the result, troll the
developers or otherwise can't be verified were removed from the survey.
The results of those entries did not count, and comments attached to
such responses have been discarded.<br>
      <br clear="all">
      <h3>Operating system distribution</h3>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 353px; height: 202px;" alt="chart" src="primary-os.png"></div>
Among our users responding to the survey, we've seen a very big
percentage of people primarily using Linux. This may be a sign of the
general shift in our population, or an indicator of more people
starting to use Linux overall. At any rate, it will mean that we will
most definitely provide ample focus on Linux-specific improvements
going forward.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Primary browser distribution</h3>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 703px; height: 212px;" alt="chart" src="primarybrowser.png"> </div>
About 80% of the respondents use Pale Moon as their primary web browser
to surf the web. The other 20% uses either a different browser or
multiple (other) browsers to varying degrees. Of course it is fantastic
to see so many users using Pale Moon as their main (or only) web
browser of note.<br>
Among our users responding to the survey, the main reasons for not
using Pale Moon as their primary browser have been:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Extension compatibility with Firefox extensions.
Unfortunately, it's not possible for us to provide exact compatibility
with Firefox extensions because we are not Firefox. Because of our
different application code, we are also not able to provide
compatibility with WebExtensions at this time, because those use HTML
for user interface elements instead of XUL. We are, however, working on
providing an as broad as possible support for the three main extension
formats in use: XUL, bootstrapped and SDK (in the form of PMkit); the
technologies that Mozilla is going to completely abandon in November
2017 with Firefox 57.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Website
compatibility. As long as websites keep
specifically checking for and catering to (specific versions of) only 3
or 4 "mainstream" browsers, you will always have some sites that will
not cooperate with using an independent alternative. On the browser
side, there is very little we can do to prevent this. As a user,
however, you have the power to convince websites to give this attention
by contacting webmasters of troublesome sites and making them aware of
their restrictions.<br>
</li>
        <li>"Firefox is more secure". There is still a percentage of
people that take arbitrary version numbers as a criterion at face value
to determine what is, in their opinion, "outdated" or "insecure". Once
more here the affirmation that Pale Moon is most definitely as secure,
if not more so, than the current mainstream browsers. Our versioning is
also independent of the versioning used by Mozilla. Security
vulnerabilities that become known in the Mozilla platform code ar
evaluated regularly and ported across if applicable.<br>
        </li>
        <li>"Chrome is faster". This may be, depending on what you use
to measure "speed"; in our experience though, there is no significant
difference between any of the modern browsers when it comes to
real-world speed. In fact, Pale Moon has regularly shown to perform
very well in comparison on lower-end computers. Your Mileage May Vary
in this respect.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Importance of browser technologies and components</h3>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 391px; height: 33px;" alt="chart" src="importance-legend.png"> </div>
The main part of our survey consisted of a number of questions, asking
our users to indicate to what level components and technologies are
important to them in Pale Moon. This was scaled from 1 to 5, where 1
(dark blue) means "not important at all" and 5 (purple) means "this is
essential".<br>
      <br>
Most of these graphs will speak for themselves, so they won't have any
additonal comments and will just serve as a general guideline for
development and what we'll give more priority.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left; display: table-cell; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><img style="width: 144px; height: 184px;" alt="graph" src="i-manyimage.png" align="left" hspace="10">We will soon extend our already broad image
format support with JPEG-XR (Extended Range JPEG), an ISO-standardized
image format with JPEG-alike compression but support for more features
like alpha transparency.<br>
We already support WebP images (and have so for quite a long time).<br>
This in addition to the standard image formats supported by the Mozilla
platform: GIF, (A)PNG, ICO, BMP, JPG.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left; display: table-cell; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><img style="width: 191px; height: 169px;" alt="graph" src="i-manyaudio.png" align="left" hspace="10">As part of our work on the media back-end, we
are giving audio formats plenty of attention. Our support for audio
formats is already broad and should cover all commonly-used formats on
the web.<br>
Depending on adoption on the web, we <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> add more formats in the future seeing as this
is considered an important feature.<br>

playback is one of our main development focus
points at the moment. We are working on improving general parsing and
handling of both normally-served and streamed video; be aware however
that this is a complex task and a large amount of work and as such will
take time - expect gradual improvements here, though!<br>

regularly asked for ways to synchronize bookmarks and tabs in the
survey comments. Pale Moon Sync is available exactly for that purpose!<br>
      <br>
At the same time, a lot of people found it not important at all to
have, as the graph shows...<br>

essential by a vast majority of our users. It is still surprising that
the mainstream browsers are insisting on removing support for
plug-ins when there are so many uses for them, beyond Flash (the
most well-known one): e.g. authentication plug-ins, control plug-ins
for hardware, banking/card reader, etc.<br>
      <br>
Pale Moon as such <span style="font-weight: bold;">will continue</span> to support NPAPI plug-ins.<br>

      <div style="text-align: left; display: table-cell; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><img style="width: 152px; height: 220px;" alt="chart" src="i-extensions.png" align="left" hspace="10">Pretty much a unanimous vote here (even among
the 20% who don't use Pale Moon as their main browser) that extensions
are essential to the browser. Totally expected, and maybe Mozilla can
draw a lesson from this.<br>
      <br>
This also underwrites the need for what we've been working on to
restore: as much compatibility with Jetpack-style extensions as
possible through PMkit.<br>
      </div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left; display: table-cell; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><img style="width: 136px; height: 211px;" alt="chart" src="i-gamepad.png" align="left" hspace="10">And
last but not least in this section, as expected, people find the
ability to use a gamepad to control/interface with the browser absolutely not useful
or desired. As a result, we'll be removing this feature from Pale Moon.<br>
      <br>
Of note, it's decisions like these that lower our "score" in things
like HTML5 tests. That doesn't mean we don't properly support the
standard, but rather that "gadgeteer use" of the browser is kept under
control. It's part of the standard, but it's not useful for our
audience and eveything like this added to the browser makes the code
more complex and potentially more vulnerable to attack. For example: <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1543">CVE-2014-1543</a><br>
</div>
      <br>
      <h3>What if: media sites use restrictive methods for media playback?</h3>
What if your favorite Media Streaming site would stop working
completely with Pale Moon, because they require their preferred DRM to
be baked into any browser?<br>

      
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 447px; height: 206px;" alt="chart" src="mediasites.png"></div>
      <br>
The message here is clear: users have no issue using a different
browser to get their media just from that website (and probably would
be just as happy with a desktop application specifically for the
streaming site IF executed properly).<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Of note</span>: a good 1/3rd of
our users would stop using the Media Streaming site altogether if it's
not kept open/accessible. I hope site owners become aware of these
numbers and act accordingly if they don't want to lose their customers.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>What if: extensions start using incompatible technologies?</h3>
Your favorite browser extensions decide they are going to switch to a
different technology not supported by Pale Moon. You have the choice to
keep using an older version of the extension, or to switch browser.
What do you do?<br>


      
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 451px; height: 204px;" alt="chart" src="extensions.png"></div>

      <br>
This one speaks for itself, really. With a percentage of people willing
to fork extensions (if allowed) and others clearly in favor of staying
with Pale Moon despite the extension being unmaintianed or unsupported
by its author, there's a good base to continue growing our Pale Moon
extensions ecosystem. As such we'll make sure to make it easier for
extension developers to distribute extensions compatible with us.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>What if: web sites no longer work?</h3>
What if your favorite websites or social media sites completely stop
working in Pale Moon, because the webmasters decide they want to use a
very specific combination of (non-standard) features that are only
supported by 2 or 3 browsers they specifically wrote for, instead of
making their site broadly-accessible?<br>


      
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 442px; height: 202px;" alt="chart" src="brokensites.png"></div>

      <br>
No less than 30% would solidly choose to stop using the website and
move to alternatives that provide similar features or content. So,
webmasters, beware: making your site less accessible to an audience
choosing a non-mainstram (one may say; non-commercial) web browser will
make people leave for greener (more open) pastures! It's better to
focus on being broadly accessible than having the latest "shiny
features". Even among those that would stay loyal to the site or can't
live without its functionality, people would rather use a dedicated
browser for it than abandoning Pale Moon. A very positive approach from
our users - thank you!<br>
Of course we will continue to be reactive to demand and implement
features as-needed, but since it relies very much on the involvement of
community members (unfortunately only a very small percentage wants to
get actually involved according to the survey) some of these may take a
long time before they make it into the browser. Getting involved in our
development is essential to make the browser work long-term for
everyone.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Our audience</h3>
Since more than 95% of our respondents chose to tell us these optional
things, we have some idea of our general browser audience, which, in
short, amounts to experienced to very advanced computer users from all
ages, but mainly over 20 (millennials seem to prefer different
browsers), with a large percentage using the browser for a (very) large
part of their day.<br>

      <h3>Selected comment responses<br>
      </h3>
All comments submitted (in valid responses) have been read and taken
along in our evaluation of this survey. We thank everyone for taking
the time to write down and submit their thoughts and comments; of
course it's not possible to provide a response to all of them, but
responding to a few comments and concerns here:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>DRM: We're aware that in-browser DRM is being pushed pretty
hard by several big players (who, not-so-coincidentally, are also
involved in editing and publishing the very HTML specifications that
make this possible in-browser) and our approach is that "black-box" DRM
content decoding modules have no place in an Open Source browser. It is
even debatable whether DRM actually does anything to combat what it is
supposed to be designed for.<br>
In light of this, and also following the results from this survey, we
remain firm in that, out of principle as well as our users' desire, we
will keep the browser completely free of DRM. People who have commented
that this approach was (one of) the main reason(s) to choose Pale Moon
as their browser can rest easy in the knowledge that it will not find
its way into this browser.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Extensions: We are working on making things as compatible
as technically possible with Firefox extensions; the threshhold for
extension developers to switch target application to Pale Moon should,
at this point, be sufficiently low for any dev to start or continue to
support us or for others to (license permitting) fork for us. We are
also working on improving the Pale Moon add-ons site to become a more
full-featured publishing platform for developers. All of this will be
given shape as this year progresses, and we hope to be able to offer a
comfortable environment for extension developers to continue their work
in for Pale Moon in light of the demise of "legacy" extensions for
Firefox.<br>
However, of note: we are not Firefox and our compatibility mode can
only go so far. it will require some work to target Pale Moon. If you
are a user looking for certain extensions, you should visit our add-ons
site and see if anyone has made a Pale Moon specific version/fork. Most
of the most popular extensions for Firefox have alternatives on our
site.</li>
        <li>Security, privacy, stability: These have always been and
will always remain very important points for any incarnation of Pale
Moon. We will continue to strive to be ahead of the curve in terms of
security, and striking a sane balance as regards privacy vs. usability.
Expect us to continue to evaluate and implement fixes for any known
platform vulnerabilities that become known at Mozilla, as well as
individually-reported Pale Moon specific issues. And above all,
remember: while our version number may not be a runaway train, we are
most definitely up-to-date and at least on-par with current "big"
browsers in terms of keeping our users safe.<br>
