Moon unstable releases - release notes<br>
      </h1>
      <span class="c3">These
release notes are for pre-release versions of Pale Moon. They may
include notes for public betas and the intended "rolling" unstable
channel we have planned for the near future.<br>
Please understand that these release notes are concise summaries, nothing more.<br>
</span><br>

If you find bugs in these versions, please report them in the <a href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/Pale-Moon/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a>
on GitHub for Pale Moon. When you do so, please <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">check if the bug has
already been reported before by others</span> to prevent duplicate entries in
the tracker. If you report bugs, make sure to include the build date
(as found in the about box) and provide clear information about the bug:<br>


      
      <ul>
<li>Clear
indication of what version of the browser this was found in (x86, x64,
Windows, Linux, exact version and build (see "About" box)<br>
</li><li>Clear description of the bug found, with a concise and clear title for the issue<br>
(include exact circumstances and exact error messages, if any)<br>
        </li><li>Steps to reproduce<br>
(what exactly do you do to cause the bug to become apparent?)<br>
        </li><li>Expected results<br>
(given the steps taken, what did you expect the browser to do?)<br>
        </li><li>Actual results<br>
(what did the browser do instead of what was expected?)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>


Also make sure that before you report a bug, that you verify if the bug
also manifests with default preferences and no installed add-ons
(preferably create a new profile to check).<br>

      <h3>Current trunk progress since release (major changes only):</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Completely changed the media handling for Linux:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Switched to use MediaFormatReader to better parse media files</li>
          <li>Added our own parser for MP3 files<br>
          </li>

          <li>Switched to FFmpeg/libav codec</li>
          <li>Removed the use of gstreamer by default for all media<br>
          </li>
          <li>Added FFmpeg 3.x support</li>
          <li>Made MSE/H.264 work</li>
          <li>Added MP4-backed quicktime playback support<br>
          </li>

        </ul>
        <li>Restored classic about:config styling</li>
        <li>Added a fallback to US-ASCII if the autoconfig UTF-8 conversion fails</li>
        <li>Improved cross-compartment wrapper handling when managing a large number of tabs (performance)</li>
        <li>Changed the way audio and video synchronization is
calculated to account for (slow) device latency, preventing things from
getting out of sync.</li>
        <li>Changed the way scripts are handled when they are stopped
from the "unresponsive script" dialog, to prevent browser lockup. We
will now stop all scripts in the affected compartment in one go.</li>
        <li>Fixed several errors in the devtools.</li>
        <li>Fixed a nasty crash caused by cross-origin referrers.</li>
        <li>Fixed the installer to allow 64-bit versions of the browser to be installed on Vista.</li>
        <li>Added HTML5-spec clipboard handling for content (cut&amp;copy only -- paste is not allowed for security reasons).</li>
        <li>Made multiple changes to the jetpack modules to cater to PMkit extensions.</li>
        <li>Fixed a css layout issue: make max-width affect contributions to intrinsic min-width.</li>
        <li>Implemented several updates to the permissions manager (needs testing!)</li>
        <li>Removed Metro browser platform/widget code.</li>
        <li>Removed support for non-standard/deprecated let blocks and expressions.</li>
        <li>Made the use of let as a keyword versionless and ES6 compliant.</li>
        <li>Improved the permissions manager (about:permissions) with a more complete set of permissions.</li>
        <li>Made the privacy category in preferences a tabbed setup.</li>
        <li>Fixed a regression preventing certain MP4 video files from playing.</li>
        <li>Fixed a regression where seeking in media files would halt playback/jump to the end of the stream.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash caused by certain downloadable fonts with DirectWrite in use.</li>
        <li>Improved downloads-button indicator legibility on some combinations of Windows versions and system theme colors.</li>




      </ul>
      <h3>Current trunk progress past v27.1 branch:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated the ICU lib to 58.2.</li>
        <li>Added proper control for the user for offline storage for web applications.</li>
        <li>No longer building GStreamer support by default.</li>
        <li>Added a check to prevent auto-filled URLs from copying the autofilled selection to clipboard/primary.</li>
        <li>Added the feature to pass a URL to open in a private window from the command-line.</li>
        <li>Improved the display of the downloads indicator on the button in brighttext situations.<br>
        </li>
        <li>DOM storage now honors the "3rd party cookie" setting in
that it will not allow 3rd party data to be stored if 3rd party cookies
are disallowed.</li>
        <li>CORS now treats data: URIs as the same origin (re: Facebook reload issue).<br>
        </li>

      </ul>
