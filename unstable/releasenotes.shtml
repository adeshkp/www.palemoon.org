      <h1> Pale
Moon unstable releases - release notes<br>
      </h1>
      <span class="c3">These
release notes are for pre-release versions of Pale Moon. They may
include notes for public betas and the "rolling" unstable
channel.<br>
Please understand that these release notes are concise summaries,
nothing more, and not an exhaustive record of all changes.<br>
      </span><br>
If you find bugs in these versions, please report them in the <a
 href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/UXP/issues"
 target="_blank">issue tracker</a>
on GitHub for UXP. When you do so, please <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">check if the bug has
already been reported before by others</span> to prevent duplicate
entries in
the tracker. If you report bugs, make sure to include the build date
(as found in the about box) and provide clear information about the bug:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear
indication of what version of the browser this was found in (x86, x64,
Windows, Linux, exact version and build (see "About" box))<br>
        </li>
        <li>Clear description of the bug found, with a concise and
clear title for the issue<br>
(include exact circumstances and exact error messages, if any)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Steps to reproduce<br>
(what exactly do you do to cause the bug to become apparent?)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Expected results<br>
(given the steps taken, what did you expect the browser to do?)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Actual results<br>
(what did the browser do instead of what was expected?)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
Also make sure that before you report a bug, that you verify if the bug
also manifests with default preferences and no installed add-ons
(preferably create a new profile to check).<br>

      <h3>Current trunk progress (major and recent changes
only):</h3>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved CSS grid rendering.</li>
        <li>Removed the silent fallback to insecure install locations
on Windows.<br>
Pale Moon will no longer by default install into unprotected program
locations (this was a regression in v28).<br>
If your operating system account does not have the necessary
privileges, you need to manually select an accessible folder to install
into. This is important to prevent malware from modifying installed
programs in well-known but otherwise unprotected installation locations.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed the non-standard <code>object.prototype.watch()/unwatch()</code>
functions. Please note that this may affect some extensions; those will
need to be updated to no longer use these non-standard functions.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed the status bar module to work around an issue with
relying on <code>watch()/unwatch()</code>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added support for modern Solaris operating systems like
Illumos (thanks Athenian200!).</li>
        <li>Fixed a build failure in the libcubeb sndio module.</li>
        <li>Changed the way tables are rendered to fix a number of spec
compliance issues and allow relative positioning of table parts.</li>
        <li>Implemented <code>position:sticky</code> for table parts -
You can now use CSS to e.g. stick table headers so they don't scroll
off the screen!</li>
        <li>Now building against the Windows 10 SDK 10.0.17763.132 for
increased compatibility with Windows 10 and improved Spectre mitigation.</li>
        <li>Added a preference for, and disabled, the confirmation
prompt
for URL authentication (prevents evil traps).</li>
        <li>Removed the unused DiskSpaceWatcher component.</li>
        <li>Fixed the certificate retrieval logic in the certificate
exception dialog.</li>
        <li>Updated cairo code.</li>
        <li>Enabled basic implementation of module type scripting.
While not fully spec compliant (yet), this will fix the few web
compatibility issues with sites that rely on this feature without
fallback (e.g. the Chromium bugtracker).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed Adobe PrimeTime DRM support. (platform change, N/A
for Pale Moon)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated SQLite to 3.30.1.</li>
        <li>Implemented Promise.<code>prototype.finally()</code>
(ES2018).</li>
        <li>Implemented Regular Expression lookbehind (ES2018).</li>
        <li>Implemented Regular Expression /s flag (dotAll support)
(ES2018).</li>
        <li>Implemented <code>String.prototype.matchAll</code> (regex)
(ES2020).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the Brotli library to 1.0.7.</li>
        <li>Updated the woff2 library to 1.0.2.</li>
        <li>Updated the OpenType Sanitizer to 8.0.0.</li>
        <li>Disabled the use of HPKP by default due to the inherent
risks involved with this feature. A preference was added to completely
disable header processing, and using preloaded pins is effectively
disabled. Please note that this is automatically disabled by default
for everyone, regardless of your previous setting for this feature, and
it is strongly recommended you keep this feature disabled. HPKP will
eventually be removed (overall Internet concensus).</li>
        <li>Added Ekoru to the list of default search engines. This is
a Bing-backed search engine that donates the majority of its revenue to
various charities that support the planet and animals. An
environment-supporting alternative to Ecosia if you don't want to
support Google in the process.</li>
        <li>Updated the Javascript math library for precision and
performance fixes.</li>
        <li>Reinstated the mentioning of the number of
accelerated/total windows in Troubleshooting Information, for
completeness.</li>
        <li>Updated the embedded Emoji font to Mozilla's COLR-mapped
twemoji 0.5.0 (Twemoji 12.1.3), to support Emoji 12.</li>
        <li>Moved the embedded font for Emoji from application to
platform so all UXP applications can easily benefit from it (thanks
Tobin!).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with add-ons potentially getting confused
during add-on updates due to cached scripts.</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash due to unnecessary reparenting calls in
layout.</li>
        <li>Changed packaging for archives to use 7z/xz instead of
zip/bz2.</li>
        <li>Made the second argument of (DOM/CSS) <code>insertRule()</code>
optional for (Chrome) web compatibility.</li>
        <li>Cleaned up the jemalloc code: Removed dead/unused code,
removed conditionals around "always on" code, and made the allocator
VLA-free.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
