      <h1> Pale
Moon unstable releases - release notes<br>
      </h1>
      <span class="c3">These
release notes are for pre-release versions of Pale Moon. They may
include notes for public betas and the intended "rolling" unstable
channel we have planned for the near future.<br>
Please understand that these release notes are concise summaries,
nothing more.<br>
      </span><br>
If you find bugs in these versions, please report them in the <a
 href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/Pale-Moon/issues"
 target="_blank">issue tracker</a>
on GitHub for Pale Moon. When you do so, please <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">check if the bug has
already been reported before by others</span> to prevent duplicate
entries in
the tracker. If you report bugs, make sure to include the build date
(as found in the about box) and provide clear information about the bug:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear
indication of what version of the browser this was found in (x86, x64,
Windows, Linux, exact version and build (see "About" box)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Clear description of the bug found, with a concise and
clear title for the issue<br>
(include exact circumstances and exact error messages, if any)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Steps to reproduce<br>
(what exactly do you do to cause the bug to become apparent?)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Expected results<br>
(given the steps taken, what did you expect the browser to do?)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Actual results<br>
(what did the browser do instead of what was expected?)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
Also make sure that before you report a bug, that you verify if the bug
also manifests with default preferences and no installed add-ons
(preferably create a new profile to check).<br>

      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Dropped support for Direct2D 1.0 to avoid font rendering
issues. Windows installations not capable of using Direct2D 1.1 will
now fall back to software rendering. As a result, fonts may look
different from this version onwards if you are on Windows Vista or
Windows 7. Users on Windows 7 affected by this should install the <a
 href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36805"
 target="_blank">Platform Update</a> to re-enable Direct2D.</li>
        <li>Fixed image decoder calls to make sure the image load event
doesn't fire prematurely.</li>
        <li>Fixed "Remove from history" function from the downloads
panel.</li>
        <li>Added extra proxy settings in Options, covering DNS lookups
through SOCKS v5 and automatic proxy authentication with known
credentials.</li>
        <li>Added an option to clear Site Connectivity Data (delete
history).</li>
        <li>Fixed the dropmarker in the address bar to allow the
suggestions to be closed with a click.</li>
        <li>Updated LibPNG to 1.6.28, and enabled faster SSE2 decoding.</li>
        <li>Updated the Brotli decoder library, and enabled support for
Brotli HTTP content-encoding by default.</li>
        <li>Updated WOFF2 code from upstream.</li>
        <li>Forced focus on the address bar in new windows if the
content is a blank/empty document.</li>
        <li>Worked around some more issues with broken Apple fonts.</li>
        <li>Added notifications to inform users about WebExtensions not
being supported if they try to install them (as opposed to "extension
is corrupt")</li>
        <li>Further cleaned up the status bar code.</li>
        <li>Disabled window.showModalDialog; it's been removed from the
spec 2 years ago and has potential abuse issues (modal dialogs block
the UI)</li>
        <li>Fixed a potential build issue.</li>
        <li>Made general improvements to internal code structure and
spec adherence.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with certain command-line parameters being
used.</li>
        <li>Fixed some debug-only assertion errors.</li>
        <li>Removed stale entries from the HSTS preload list, and
improved generation/processing of it.</li>
        <li>Added a number of DOM childNode convenience functions. This
should fix some lazy-loading frameworks.<br>
(enjoy your LOLcats again!)</li>
        <li>Added pretty-printing for ECDSA-SHA224, 256, 384 and 512
hashed certificate signatures.</li>
        <li>Removed undesired certificate issuer organization to common
name fallback (if issuer org is empty).</li>
        <li>Updated the zlib compression library.</li>
        <li>Updated the default theme to improve consistency and
contrast of toolbar and download buttons.</li>
        <li>Increased the default duration of notification pop-ups and
made them configurable.</li>
        <li>Improved handling of audio-visual media (ongoing).</li>
        <li>Added a selectable fallback character encoding of UTF-8 and
fallback to UTF-8 as a last effort. (Issue #1423)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with the KISS-FFT library causing
CPU-deadlocked threads (Issue #1425)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue in CSS where elements would sometimes reflow
to the next line even with sufficient visual space.</li>
        <li>Changed automatic updates over to the new infrastructure.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
