Moon unstable releases - release notes<br>
      </h1>
      <span class="c3">These
release notes are for pre-release versions of Pale Moon. They may
include notes for public betas and the intended "rolling" unstable
channel we have planned for the near future.<br>
Please understand that these release notes are concise summaries, nothing more.<br>
</span><br>

If you find bugs in these versions, please report them in the <a href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/Pale-Moon/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a>
on GitHub for Pale Moon. When you do so, please <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">check if the bug has
already been reported before by others</span> to prevent duplicate entries in
the tracker. If you report bugs, make sure to include the build date
(as found in the about box) and provide clear information about the bug:<br>


      
      <ul>
<li>Clear
indication of what version of the browser this was found in (x86, x64,
Windows, Linux, exact version and build (see "About" box)<br>
</li><li>Clear description of the bug found, with a concise and clear title for the issue<br>
(include exact circumstances and exact error messages, if any)<br>
        </li><li>Steps to reproduce<br>
(what exactly do you do to cause the bug to become apparent?)<br>
        </li><li>Expected results<br>
(given the steps taken, what did you expect the browser to do?)<br>
        </li><li>Actual results<br>
(what did the browser do instead of what was expected?)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>


Also make sure that before you report a bug, that you verify if the bug
also manifests with default preferences and no installed add-ons
(preferably create a new profile to check).<br>

<h2>Pale Moon v27 public beta 2 (2016-10-10)</h2>Making progress with the bugfixes.<br>
Public beta 2 should be feature-complete enough for daily use. It's obviously going to still have bugs in it.<br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Most important changes/fixes since beta 1:</span><br>

      
      <ul>
<li>Fixed up most of the devtools.</li><li>Removed WebappRT.</li><li>Fixed OCSP options.</li><li>Removed inclusion of the WindowsXP DirectX library for WebGL.<br>
(no longer in use on supported platforms)<br>
</li><li>Fixed about:credits.</li><li>Fixed a crash in offsetX/Y events (e.g. triggered by IMDB videos)</li><li>Changed
 the "default browser" Windows system integration for later versions of 
Windows to work around Microsoft blocking explicit control panel module 
calls.</li><li>Restored wider spacing to about:config for the time being.</li><li>Fixed html button content padding</li><li>Fixed RSS feeds view/subscription</li><li>Fixed up some media back-end issues + added improvements</li><li>Updated libVPX to 1.4</li><li>Fixed missing tabstrip scroll arrows</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Pale Moon v27 public beta 1 (2016-10-04)<br>
      </h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Important changes since the Alpha stages:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Sync is available. Casual testing has been performed to set up a new account and synchronize data.<br>
One known issue that isn't directly related to sync is that when
syncing add-ons, downloads of these add-ons may fail (for security
reasons).<br>
        </li>
        <li>The status bar and indicators are back! We've worked on fully integrating the relevant code.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Pale Moon now has devtools available again. This includes a
more modern port of them from a later Firefox version. Expect to find
some bugs here, since the integration into our front-end is rather
complex.</li>
        <li>This version doesn't come with an updater because we want
to, at this point, have a known control point for bugfixing. To update
to a later version you'll have to manually install.</li>
      </ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Added features since the previous version:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added a preference to control Generational Garbage
Collection in the JavaScript engine and disabled it by default after
extensive comparative testing.</li>
        <li>Improved worst-case minor garbage collection latency and releasing of wrapped JS code.</li>
        <li>Animated SVG in OpenType fonts now work and don't kill browser responsiveness.</li>
        <li>Implemented an improved implementation of <code>background-repeat:space</code> and <code>background-repeat:round</code> CSS statements.</li>
        <li>Added <code>MouseEvent.offsetX</code> and <code>MouseEvent.offsetY</code>.</li>
        <li>Added the "noopener" link option for hyperlinks.</li>
        <li>Added several optimizations and improvements for Vista and higher versions of Windows.</li>
        <li>Added many media handling improvements</li>
        <li>Implemented HTTP/2 pseudo-header restrictions in accordance with RFC 7540.</li>
      </ul>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional important information:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>We do <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> support
Jetpack/add-on SDK extensions any longer. Any extensions falling into
this category will now be clearly marked as such in the Add-on Manager
in the browser.</li>
        <li>The browser is available in US-English only. Our current release language packs will not work.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
