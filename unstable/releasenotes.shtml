      <h1> Pale
Moon unstable releases - release notes<br>
      </h1>
      <span class="c3">These
release notes are for pre-release versions of Pale Moon. They may
include notes for public betas and the "rolling" unstable
channel.<br>
Please understand that these release notes are concise summaries,
nothing more, and not an exhaustive record of all changes.<br>
      </span><br>
If you find bugs in these versions, please report them in the <a
 href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/UXP/issues"
 target="_blank">issue tracker</a>
on GitHub for UXP. When you do so, please <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">check if the bug has
already been reported before by others</span> to prevent duplicate
entries in
the tracker. If you report bugs, make sure to include the build date
(as found in the about box) and provide clear information about the bug:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear
indication of what version of the browser this was found in (x86, x64,
Windows, Linux, exact version and build (see "About" box))<br>
        </li>
        <li>Clear description of the bug found, with a concise and
clear title for the issue<br>
(include exact circumstances and exact error messages, if any)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Steps to reproduce<br>
(what exactly do you do to cause the bug to become apparent?)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Expected results<br>
(given the steps taken, what did you expect the browser to do?)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Actual results<br>
(what did the browser do instead of what was expected?)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
Also make sure that before you report a bug, that you verify if the bug
also manifests with default preferences and no installed add-ons
(preferably create a new profile to check).<br>

      <h3>Current trunk progress (major and recent changes
only):</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved handling of FTP resource loading (allow save-as
and cater to some FTP browsing).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a preference (<code>security.block_ftp_subresources</code>)
to
allow users to bypass this blocking if required for their environment.</li>
        <li>Added blocking of authentication-locked cross-origin image
subresources by default to prevent spurious auth prompts.<br>
A preference (<code>network.auth.subresource-http-img-XO-auth</code>)
was added to
allow users to bypass this blocking if required for their environment.</li>
        <li>Changed the behavior of file: URIs to treat each URI as a
unique origin. This prevents cross-file access from scripting.<br>
A preference (<code>security.fileuri.unique_origin</code>) was added to
allow users to relax this restriction if required for their environment.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added a DiD fix for cross-thread access of Necko.</li>
        <li>Updated NSS to 3.41.2 to pick up some upstream fixes.</li>
        <li>Implemented a revised version of http2PushedStream to
address some issues.</li>
        <li>Implemented several DiD and security patches ported from
Mozilla.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved performance dealing with frame properties.</li>
        <li>Removed the Financial Times' polyfill user-agent override
since they updated their detection to work with Pale Moon.</li>
        <li>Improved performance for handling html5 strings.</li>
        <li>Fixed potential type confusion in array joins.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue on some pages causing high CPU usage when
wrongly specifying plugin content.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with the add-ons manager "discover" pane if
no network connection is present.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Removed e10s information from about:troubleshooting.</li>
        <li>Removed hotfix leftovers.</li>
        <li>Removed the WebIDE developer tool.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Added support for matroska containers and h264-based webm
video formats.</li>
        <li>Added support for AAC audio in matroska and webm video
formats.</li>
        <li>Aligned browser behavior with mainstream regarding inner
window behavior when domain is manipulated.</li>
        <li>Backed out a 28.5.* patch for causing multiple issues in
the UI and web content.</li>
        <li>Landed a large JavaScript parser tune-up, which as a
targeted goal brings our ES6 stringification fully in line with the
ES2018 revision for classes, and implements rest/spread parameters for
object literals. (Cheers to Luke!)</li>
        <li>Fixed a crash with the tuned-up parser code when certain
error messages were triggered.</li>
        <li>Added support for spaces in the Mac package name.</li>
        <li>Removed conditional build-time disabling of the Pale Moon
status bar code.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
