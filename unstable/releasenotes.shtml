Moon unstable releases - release notes<br>
      </h1>
      <span class="c3">These
release notes are for pre-release versions of Pale Moon. They may
include notes for public betas and the intended "rolling" unstable
channel we have planned for the near future.<br>
Please understand that these release notes are concise summaries, nothing more.<br>
</span><br>

If you find bugs in these versions, please report them in the <a href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/Pale-Moon/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a>
on GitHub for Pale Moon. When you do so, please <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">check if the bug has
already been reported before by others</span> to prevent duplicate entries in
the tracker. If you report bugs, make sure to include the build date
(as found in the about box) and provide clear information about the bug:<br>


      
      <ul>
<li>Clear
indication of what version of the browser this was found in (x86, x64,
Windows, Linux, exact version and build (see "About" box)<br>
</li><li>Clear description of the bug found, with a concise and clear title for the issue<br>
(include exact circumstances and exact error messages, if any)<br>
        </li><li>Steps to reproduce<br>
(what exactly do you do to cause the bug to become apparent?)<br>
        </li><li>Expected results<br>
(given the steps taken, what did you expect the browser to do?)<br>
        </li><li>Actual results<br>
(what did the browser do instead of what was expected?)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>


Also make sure that before you report a bug, that you verify if the bug
also manifests with default preferences and no installed add-ons
(preferably create a new profile to check).<br>

<h2>Pale Moon v27 public beta 3 (2016-10-27)</h2>A lot more polishing
and bugfixing, working through the last blockers for the coming
release. You may consider this stable enough for just about all intents
and purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Most important changes/fixes since beta 2:</span><br>
      <ul>
<li>This should fix webcrypto issues people have reported.</li><li>Fixed places/library category errors (tags etc).</li><li>Fixed geolocation (prompt and lookup, "more information").</li><li>Fixed desktop notification and pointerlock prompts.</li><li>Fixed the "more information" link for mixed content.</li><li>Removed pdf.js from the browser.<br>
Considering this preview module (maintained for emergency only) would
not render even half the documents correctly, it has been removed from
Pale Moon. Some websites that insist on only having embedded PDF
content (not downloadable and not using a web-based viewer on-site) may
require you to install a PDF plugin as a result.<br>
</li><li>Fixed the "ask to activate" image+link in plugin areas.</li><li>Fixed the browser downloads UI call in BrowserDownloadsUI().</li><li>Enforced Firefox-compatibility useragent on msn.com and bing.com to prevent errors.</li><li>Fixed the save file picker dialog closing immediately on some sites (e.g. dropbox).</li><li>Fixed missing toolbar in print preview.</li><li>Fixed "Forget about this site" command.</li><li>Fixed an issue with update logging.</li><li>Added
 a new option and control to determine whether to save zone information 
(downloaded from the Internet) on downloaded files (Windows+NTFS).<br>
You can find this option in the "General" category of browser options.<br>
</li><li>Fixed a regression causing memory inflation and crash due to onload= changes to &lt;link&gt; and style elements.</li><li>Fixed favicon handling on hash navigation.</li><li>Added
 indicators in the add-ons manager for native (blue)/non-native (orange)
 extensions, to more easily pinpoint which extensions are Pale Moon 
specific and which are Firefox extensions.</li><li>Fixed an issue with xlink:href navigation (e.g. embedded &lt;a&gt; links inside SVG).</li><li>Fixed an issue with SVG favicons on sites not being seen as valid nor being cached properly.</li><li>Switched AMO useragent override to be v28.9 instead of v24.9, to be closer to our FE+platform spec.</li><li>Updated OTS to 5.1 from upstream + fixed a visibility issue in it.</li><li>Updated the woff2 code from upstream.</li><li>Hard-blocked the classic theme restorer (CTR) extension -- just in case.</li><li>Fixed History menu "restore all tabs".</li><li>Fixed font preferences fallback encoding selection.</li><li>Removed the (unused) maintenance service code.</li><li>Changed the media/video parsing/rendering logic.</li><li>Added MSE enable/disable options to the Options dialog.<br>
You can find these options in the "Content" category of browser options.<br>
</li><li>Enabled @font-face unicode-range parsing in CSS.</li><li>Added use of object array and typed object array <em>.includes()</em>.</li><li>Fixed the offline application cache to work properly with http cache v2.</li><li>Removed confusion in preferences for the use of https cache back-ends.<br>
The preference to select the back-end is now called <code>browser.cache.backend</code> (numeric).<br>
Set to 0 for the old back-end (deprecated) or 1 for the new back-end.<br>
</li><li>Fixed up OS X default theme styling.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>Pale Moon v27 public beta 2 (2016-10-10)</h2>
Making progress with the bugfixes.<br>
Public beta 2 should be feature-complete enough for daily use. It's obviously going to still have bugs in it.<br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Most important changes/fixes since beta 1:</span><br>

      
      <ul>
<li>Fixed up most of the devtools.</li><li>Removed WebappRT.</li><li>Fixed OCSP options.</li><li>Removed inclusion of the WindowsXP DirectX library for WebGL.<br>
(no longer in use on supported platforms)<br>
</li><li>Fixed about:credits.</li><li>Fixed a crash in offsetX/Y events (e.g. triggered by IMDB videos)</li><li>Changed
 the "default browser" Windows system integration for later versions of 
Windows to work around Microsoft blocking explicit control panel module 
calls.</li><li>Restored wider spacing to about:config for the time being.</li><li>Fixed html button content padding</li><li>Fixed RSS feeds view/subscription</li><li>Fixed up some media back-end issues + added improvements</li><li>Updated libVPX to 1.4</li><li>Fixed missing tabstrip scroll arrows</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Pale Moon v27 public beta 1 (2016-10-04)<br>
      </h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Important changes since the Alpha stages:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Sync is available. Casual testing has been performed to set up a new account and synchronize data.<br>
One known issue that isn't directly related to sync is that when
syncing add-ons, downloads of these add-ons may fail (for security
reasons).<br>
        </li>
        <li>The status bar and indicators are back! We've worked on fully integrating the relevant code.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Pale Moon now has devtools available again. This includes a
more modern port of them from a later Firefox version. Expect to find
some bugs here, since the integration into our front-end is rather
complex.</li>
        <li>This version doesn't come with an updater because we want
to, at this point, have a known control point for bugfixing. To update
to a later version you'll have to manually install.</li>
      </ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Added features since the previous version:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Added a preference to control Generational Garbage
Collection in the JavaScript engine and disabled it by default after
extensive comparative testing.</li>
        <li>Improved worst-case minor garbage collection latency and releasing of wrapped JS code.</li>
        <li>Animated SVG in OpenType fonts now work and don't kill browser responsiveness.</li>
        <li>Implemented an improved implementation of <code>background-repeat:space</code> and <code>background-repeat:round</code> CSS statements.</li>
        <li>Added <code>MouseEvent.offsetX</code> and <code>MouseEvent.offsetY</code>.</li>
        <li>Added the "noopener" link option for hyperlinks.</li>
        <li>Added several optimizations and improvements for Vista and higher versions of Windows.</li>
        <li>Added many media handling improvements</li>
        <li>Implemented HTTP/2 pseudo-header restrictions in accordance with RFC 7540.</li>
      </ul>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional important information:</span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>We do <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> support
Jetpack/add-on SDK extensions any longer. Any extensions falling into
this category will now be clearly marked as such in the Add-on Manager
in the browser.</li>
        <li>The browser is available in US-English only. Our current release language packs will not work.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
