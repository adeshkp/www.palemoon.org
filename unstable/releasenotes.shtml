      <h1> Pale
Moon unstable releases - release notes<br>
      </h1>
      <span class="c3">These
release notes are for pre-release versions of Pale Moon. They may
include notes for public betas and the intended "rolling" unstable
channel we have planned for the near future.<br>
Please understand that these release notes are concise summaries, nothing more.<br>
</span><br>

If you find bugs in these versions, please report them in the <a href="https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/Pale-Moon/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a>
on GitHub for Pale Moon. When you do so, please <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">check if the bug has
already been reported before by others</span> to prevent duplicate entries in
the tracker. If you report bugs, make sure to include the build date
(as found in the about box) and provide clear information about the bug:<br>


      
      <ul>
<li>Clear
indication of what version of the browser this was found in (x86, x64,
Windows, Linux, exact version and build (see "About" box)<br>
</li><li>Clear description of the bug found, with a concise and clear title for the issue<br>
(include exact circumstances and exact error messages, if any)<br>
        </li><li>Steps to reproduce<br>
(what exactly do you do to cause the bug to become apparent?)<br>
        </li><li>Expected results<br>
(given the steps taken, what did you expect the browser to do?)<br>
        </li><li>Actual results<br>
(what did the browser do instead of what was expected?)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>


Also make sure that before you report a bug, that you verify if the bug
also manifests with default preferences and no installed add-ons
(preferably create a new profile to check).<br>
