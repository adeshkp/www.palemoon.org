these builds for testing purposes only and are at all times used at
your own risk. They may be unstable and may
crash, do unexpected things, erase your files
or set your hair on fire. Do NOT expect release stability from these! <br>
      </h3>
That being said, if a file is here for more than a few days, it's
likely stable enough for daily use.<br>
      <br>
These files are mainly here for beta testing before release, or to test
out new and/or changed
functionality in the browser, as well as tryouts of other Mozilla
packages or for other Operating Systems, or work-in-progress public
milestone betas. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span><br>

If you wish to give feedback to these works-in-progress, please use the
forum (see below for links to dedicated threads).<br>

This is the second public beta of the new milestone release. Considering
the large amount of changes involved, there will be some issues with
websites, although at the moment they seem to be mostly centered around
useragent sniffing (Especially Google will complain).<br>
          <br>
This beta fixes applicable security vulnerabilities, fixes auto-sizing
and auto-rotation of JPEG images based on EXIF data, and adds Ruby
support (set browser.ruby.enabled to true to activate it) and of course
the other improvements found in 25.7, among other things.<br>

          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Known issues on sites:</span></li>

        <ul>
          <li>Google
does not recognize Goanna and will complain and/or offer limited
features and/or switch to "basic HTML" in some of their services
(GMail, YouTube, Google Docs, etc.). This seems to be
caused by useragent sniffing they do (tisk tisk, Google). Feel free to
let Google know about the browser and ask them to support it.</li>
          <li>Some
vBulletin-based fora don't seem to like this browser,
resulting in non-functional editing areas and toolbars. We're trying to
figure out exactly what is causing these issues, but at first glance it
seems to also be a useragent issue. We've corrected/worked around some
of the issues in this beta, but some fora still don't like it.<br>
</li>
          
          <li>Some extensions that check the
platform version may be
dysfunctional, because it's currently exposed as "1.0" to reflect the
1.0 version of the Goanna platform. Extensions will likely need to be
updated for proper support, since there are many ways to check for
platform version and we can't reasonably create "fake" values for all
of them.<br>
          </li>


          <li>If you find other major issues, please let us know so we
can add them here.<br>
