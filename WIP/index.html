these builds for testing purposes only and are at all times used at
your own risk. They may be unstable and may
crash, do unexpected things, erase your files
or set your hair on fire. Do NOT expect release stability from these! <br>
      </h3>
That being said, if a file is here for more than a few days, it's
likely stable enough for daily use.<br>
      <br>
These files are mainly here for beta testing before release, or to test
out new and/or changed
functionality in the browser, as well as tryouts of other Mozilla
packages or for other Operating Systems, or work-in-progress public
milestone betas. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span><br>

This is the first public beta of the new milestone release. Considering
the large amount of changes involved, there will be some issues with
websites, although at the moment they seem to be mostly centered around
useragent sniffing (Especially Google will complain).<br>
          <br>
This beta adds support for WebP, has faster memory handling on current Windows operating systems (at the
expense of some increased memory use), and should handle particularly
poorly-designed and/or image-heavy sites (e.g. Flickr) better, as main (non-inclusive)
improvements to the browser.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"><big style="font-weight: bold;">This
beta's feedback stage has now been closed. A new beta will be released
soon, implementing this feedback and other improvements.</big><br>

Unfortunately we cannot accept any feedback through other channels
because it would result in utter chaos for us. So please, do <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> use
e-mail, do <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> use social media, do <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> use IRC to provide feedback to this beta, and
help keep things organized for us! :)</span><br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Known issues on sites:</span></li>

        <ul>
          <li>Google
does not recognize Goanna and will complain and/or offer limited
features and/or switch to "basic HTML" in some of their services
(GMail, YouTube, Google Docs, etc.). This seems to be
caused by useragent sniffing they do (tisk tisk, Google). Feel free to
let Google know about the browser and ask them to support it.</li>
          <li>vBulletin-based fora don't seem to like this browser,
resulting in non-functional editing areas and toolbars. We're trying to
figure out exactly what is causing these issues, but at first glance it
seems to also be a useragent issue.</li>
          <li>FaceBook seems to offer limited functionality (unsizeable
comment boxes, for example) - once more determined to be a useragent
sniffing issue, and this beta not having a working useragent override
in place for them. Here, too, feel free to contact FaceBook support,
and let them know about the browser and ask them to support it.
Unfortunately their rate of responsiveness so far for Pale Moon support
has been very low.</li>
          <li>Some extensions that check appInfo.platformVersion may be
dysfunctional, because it's currently exposed as "1.0" to reflect the
1.0 version of the Goanna platform. We do plan to work around this but
it's not implemented in this first beta yet.<br>
          </li>


          <li>If you find other major issues, please let us know so we
can add them here.<br>
